I\'ve been at Berkeley for 8 months, and it is my last semester here.\
\
Being here had not been easy for me, and I faced multiple difficulties
throughout the year.\
\
Recently I got denied for club and classes.\
\
Sometimes I thought it would\'ve been better if I stayed at USTC and
decided to go to grad school in USTC instead.\
\
I felt very lonely and sometimes disappointed from not being
satisfying.\
\
But there is no turning back, and I must go face the difficulties
bravely.\
