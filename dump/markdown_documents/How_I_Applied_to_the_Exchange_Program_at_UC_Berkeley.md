When I applied, I wasn\'t very serious; I just wanted to take a chance.
I started the form on Oct 7th. At that time, I was still hesitating
about whether to go to an exchange program or not. I would like to, but
I need to do many things anyway. On Oct 26th, I had nothing to do, and
my neighborhood was locked down. Thus, I applied to the Berkeley
exchange program. (Also, UCI\'s ASAP exchange program) I realized I
wanted to go to another environment for a reasonable time. Being here
didn\'t help me realize my goals, and I was undecided about my future.

Furthermore, I\'m not too fond of lockdowns. I remembered my happy times
in 6th and 7th grade in Boston and California. I wanted to go again.

1\. Applying to Berkeley Global Access

Go to [Berkeley Global
Access](https://extension.berkeley.edu/international/academic/berkeley-global-access/).

The deadline is Nov 1st for the spring semester, so don\'t worry.

Just sign up for a student account and apply. Follow four steps and wait
to be admitted/rejected.

### Statement of Purpose (SOP) {#dadasadfasdfsf .dfasadfasdfdf}

Write 800-1000 words describing your experiences and why you stand out.

English scores: Not very high standard

Prepare about 25k dollars for one semester. You can apply for two
semesters. I didn\'t apply for summer sessions.

2\. After Applying

That\'s about all. There are many articles about the exchange semester
in Berkeley if you search on Google. Some of these students aren\'t from
prestigious universities and aren\'t studying STEM subjects. Somehow I
just got admitted.

You will receive a congratulatory letter and enroll.

3\. Enrolling and Adjusting Details

You can ask questions in the Berkeley ISS (International Student
Service) or BGA. You can easily find the email addresses if you search
on Google.

Notice that your preferred name may be different from your actual name.
If you registered using your preferred name, email them, and they will
change it for you (somehow, you can\'t change it in the profile).

The emails are replied to very quickly, and the attitudes are good. They
always say, \"thank you for reaching out,\" or something like that. It
is ok to write emails to bother them.

Then they will process your I-20

4\. Visa Application

Fill out a form and apply for an F1 visa.
