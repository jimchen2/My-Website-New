## Customizing OSS Code Font

`Ctrl+shift+p` then settings(json), this is my customization

    {
        "workbench.colorTheme": "Default Light Modern",
        "security.workspace.trust.untrustedFiles": "open",
        "editor.fontFamily": "Source Code Pro",
        "editor.fontSize": 15,
        "editor.fontWeight": "bold"

    }

## Browser Fonts

There are many ways to customize browser font. For example, you can
change the DuckDuckGo search engine fonts in its settings.

I tried a single font for everything, so I installed
[Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne).
Basically it is just adding some css to each html. My configuration

    * {
        font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace !important;
    }

In other browsers like [Epiphany
Browser](https://github.com/GNOME/epiphany), you can add some javascript
manually to run on every websites. To be honest I use Chromium primarily
since it looks clean and the shortcut `Ctrl+e`.

## System Fonts

Install Gnome Tweaks. Actually I quite enjoy this frontend customizer,
while I prefer many command line tools to apps with gui.
