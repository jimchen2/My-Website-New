## Disclaimer

This essay contains some extreme personal views and shouldn't be taken objectively.

## What is it?

I am addicted to gaming. I hate to admit it but I was, and I am still
very much addicted.

## Facts

- **No Gain and No Worth**: No depth, repetitive, simplistic, devoid of meaningful insights
- **Extremely Time-consuming**: No play or play 10 hours a day. No middle ground

## Mentally
- **Obsessive**: Mantal drain and brainwash (like malware filling up computer storage)
- **Toxic Masculin**: The urge to win in games is simply pointless
- **Escapism**: Lose touch with real challenges and responsibilities
- **Devoid of Enjoyment**: Lose touch with reality enjoyments

## Physically
- **Lack of self-care**: Leads to eating disorder and sickness
- **Eye Problems**
- **Disrupting Schedules**

## Other
- **Disruptive to people around**

## What games am I addicted to?

I consider my preference for gaming strange. I do not like the
mainstream games like Clash Royale or Honor of Kings which my classmates
play. Instead, here is a list of games I remember being addicted to
(from time order)

- **plants vs zombies** 2nd grade-4th grade
- **plants vs zombies 2** 4th grade-7th grade, sophomore year
- **plants vs zombies ol** 3rd grade-8th grade
- **carrot fantasy**\
  3rd grade-7th grade
- **carrot fantasy 2 (and the variation in 4399)** 3rd grade-7th grade
- **generals.io** 10th grade-freshman year
- **zombsroyale.io** sophomore year-now
- **brawl stars, slither.io** not too addicted

## Measures I have taken to prevent myself from gaming

I have taken multiple measures to prevent myself from gaming, with some
success and failure.

- Before 6th grade I didn\'t remember taking any measures myself.
- In 6th grade I was addicted to plants vs zombies ol, and in the
  second semester I told myself that every time I play I would write
  it on a notebook. In the end I controlled it.
- In 7th grade first semester I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2
  and carrot fantasy, and I wanted to stop gaming. One day I played
  carrot fantasy 8 hours. Shortly after, I deleted carrot fantasy.
  Then I was addicted to plants vs zombies 2, after about a month, I
  deleted plants vs zombies 2. Then I downloaded plants vs zombies 2
  and was very much addicted again, then I deleted plants vs zombies 2
  a second time. Then I started playing plants vs zombies ol, and
  couldn\'t stop playing it.doing something in its backend
- In 8th grade I told myself I must stop gaming. In November I decided
  gaming is not meaningful. It was painful and in the second semester
  I remembered trying so hard. I tried to shift my attention to long
  walks and outdoor activities. In the second semester I played
  roughly once or twice a week, or once two weeks. In the summer I
  played less afer shifting my attention completely to outdoor
  activities.
- In 9th grade I made an honest effort to stop gaming altogether. I
  played only once in September 13rd the first semester. In the second
  semester covid came. I liked going outdoors so much at that time
  that even during covid I was out walking 2 hours every day. I played
  less than 5 times the second semester, only before exams when I felt
  too much pressure.
- In 10th grade first semester, I wasn\'t too much into gaming
  anymore. However, later that semester I suffered great
  disappointment, since I tried really hard studying(the hardest I
  ever tried so far as I could remember), but still got a really low
  score. As a result, I began to feel depression and became easily
  irritated. In the second semester, I began to play generals.io
  sometimes, like about twice a week.
- In Freshman year first semester, all people in my dorm was so
  addicted to gaming, to the point I felt sick and hated the dorm. I
  hated school very much but couldn\'t do anything since I live far
  from my parents. I played generals.io sometimes, like less than 1
  hour a day. In the C Programming course I coded generals.io single
  player in C language myself. I couldn\'t do anything to stop it, but
  it wasn\'t that serious at that time. I distinctly remember in
  Janurary 1st 2022 I was playing generals.io as the clock turned. In
  the second semester, however, I grew more frustrated and hated the
  dorm even more, to the point where I suffered great emotional
  distress. I tried to control gaming by writing on my notebook before
  using computer, that \"this time I use computer only for \*\*\*
  purpose, not for gaming\". I checked my computer time usage every
  week. In the end I played for some time but it was under control.
- In Sophomore year I decided to end it for all. However, everything
  just got worse. I wrote an essay myself on why gaming is bad,
  listing all pros and cons. However, it all got worse when I began
  playing zombsroyale.io. It all started when I accidentally came
  across the game one afternoon and couldn\'t stop playing for 2 hours
  straight. In the first semester there was massive covid lockdowns,
  and I felt bored and depressed being locked down, and couldn\'t
  control myself from playing zombsroyale anymore. In the second
  semester I got on the exchange program to UC Berkeley. Then things
  got even worse. In the US, I was very lonely and unmotivated, and I
  completely lost control of playing zombsroyale. I played for more
  than 600 hours this year. I did try to stop playing, without any
  success. In October I stopped gaming for a week straight, motivated
  to do work when the school was locked down, destroying my
  motivation. In April I faced a challenging project, and started
  procrastinating, playing zombsroyale nearly all day long. I ended up
  cheating in that project. In May I decided to end gaming, and
  succeeded for a week. However, in June I was caught for the previous
  cheating, and I got very sad and fully embarrassed of myself,
  pulling myself back into emotional distress I suffered for long. In
  early August I felt completely out of motivation and dropped one of
  the summer classes, playing zombsroyale all day long for a week.
  Then I decided to stop gaming once and for all, but in the test I
  got really low scores, making me disappointed once again and lost
  motivation. Then in late August I tried to stop gaming by disabling
  zombsroyale /etc/hosts, rewriting the /etc/hosts every few seconds
  in systemctl service, and dropping the ip address of zombsroyale in
  iptables. However, the stress I faced with the coming semester was
  too huge, and I couldn\'t handle everything. As a result, I flushed
  the iptable, and manually changed /etc/hosts file and went back to
  gaming again.

## Why can\'t I stop gaming?

I did manage to stop gaming a few periods in my life successfully.
However, every time I was pulled back into gaming by emotional distress
caused by real life problems. I was pulled back by dopamine release.

## I can stop gaming after traveling

Traveling diverts my attention, and in traveling I have succeeded in not
gaming. But when facing loads of work and studying, I would often go
back to gaming all over again.

## Gaming Itself

Although gaming has all the cons, reasons are needed on why gaming is
bad.

Some invalid reasons include

- The teacher forbids me from gaming.
  - Teachers are usually not very
    smart people in tech. For example, (most) teachers don\'t know how
    to code. (Most) Teachers don\'t know how to use linux. (Most)
    Teachers don\'t know computer networking. (Most) Teachers don\'t
    know html. (Most) Teachers don\'t know computer security. Trusting
    the teacher who has limited knowledge in tech and is arrogant is
    stupid.
- Parents forbid me from gaming. Same as above
- Gaming shifts your attention from studying.
  - Everything shifts my
    attention, including studying foreign languages, planning and taking
    long walks. Just because gaming shifts my attention doesn\'t mean I
    need to quit gaming
- People who game don\'t study well
  - People in top universities with
    top scores sometimes game a lot.

Some valid reasons include

- **I gain nothing from gaming** After running I run faster, after
  studying I know more, after learning language I learn more about
  culture. However, after gaming I get nothing.
- **Time consuming** Gaming is addictive, and I usually spend more
  time than intended.
- **Mental Health Impacts** Becoming too immersed in a game can lead
  to heightened emotions and loss of control, exacerbating feelings of
  distress or agitation.
- **Social Isolation** While gaming can offer a virtual community, it
  might also mean less time spent with family or friends in the real
  world, leading to feelings of isolation or neglecting important
  relationships.

However, I must also acknowledge painfully that pros of gaming exists

- Gaming is exciting and life is boring
- Gaming is escape when facing stress
- Gaming includes online conversation, which I might want when feeling
  lonely
- Gaming moves may seem cool and accomplishing

## The essay I wrote before {#whats-next}

https://www.jimchen.me/blog/Thu%20Oct%2013%202022%2014:10:02

Gaming is like a piece of shitty bloatware, except it grows inside one's mind. It is very scary how evilly the thing affects one's well-being.

I am not saying all gaming is evil; in fact, there are plenty of very good and interesting games that don't have notable disadvantages if played under a controlled environment. Examples of this include 2048 and chess. But as far as I am concerned, a large portion of the most popular ones are very toxic.

Openai Gym games are good and interesting to play!

What a piece of shitty bloatware does to a computer is exactly what gaming does to one's mind. Bloatware, also known as **crapware**, typically refers to unnecessary software that Also, open source stuff
the average user might not need or want, and it can negatively affect a computer's performance in several ways:

- Slows down the system
- Takes up disk space
- Increases security risks
- Complicates the user experience
- Drains battery life

To sum it up, such things are mainly **resource-hungry** and **out of control**. They try to eat up your computer systems without notable contributions themselves, and negatively impact the useful stuff. Also, bloatware is usually out of a user's control. It might be backdoors imposed by companies, or monitors that log and send your personal data, or incompatible software forcing a user to use everything that company provides.

Gaming does exactly the same to one's mind! It stimulates the mind to be addicted to something useless, and in turn suppresses the mind from processing useful stuff. Also, gaming is usually out of one's control, and when someone is addicted, they practically cannot control themselves at all. Thinking about gaming on a minute basis is awfully easy when one is addicted—it just eats up the mind.

When talking about freedom, usually the first thing is about one's freedom of mind—it is as important as freedom in real life. If one's mind is out of control, a person is no different from living in a prison.

## How company exploits you

By first making you addicted to someone they have exclusivly, then suddenly increasing the price, the company is exploiting the vulnerabilities of personality. The answer to that is never get addicted to something the company earns. In truth the company can raise the money to however high they want, (gradually), and force the user to keep paying to them to play a game(or a feature that only they have). You will lose your life, honestly. If you get addicted it will strongly impact your mind and behavior, forcing you to pay for unnecessary shits and neglect other aspects of your life.

Imagine food price skyrocketed, will you still buy them? The answer is yes. For game addicts, gaming is like eating food, and not gaming is like starving(or at least equally painful, or more painful than that). The company then goes to provides "food" for the gamer, which is essential to their daily supply.

Such an act is not only unreasonable but very unethical, however, I see no law enforcements addressing this. So it is very important to be aware of the amount of control the company have on you.

## About the actual "proprietary" feature of gaming and lack of control

Gaming itself is usually designed to be hard to control since what is the point of gaming if it is easily finished or achieved? Especially those 3D gun games, like people are essentially competing against each other in a virtual world.

Thus, there is a lack of `API` in gaming. Things can only be controlled via the frontend GUI. Now, I am not against frontend GUIs, but I don't like certain frontend GUIs. Usually, you can see the amount or level of control the app gives you from the frontend GUI at one glance, to know which apps are easy to control and which ones are buggy. The most popular games seem to me at one glance to be very hard to control in the frontend part, usually requiring an enormous amount of effort over an extended period.

Now, how does gaming make you stay on the page for an extended period? Obviously, by invading one's brain to a toxic level.

Modern games typically have complicated (buggy) UIs and lack the transparency seen in open-source software, which means it is exploiting the user. Games should be transparent and be able to run on one's own server. Games should have their source code revealed for users to understand and modify. There are certain proprietary software that is pretty good, but for gaming, since they are unnecessary and aiming to control me, I believe that open source should be a must.

Moreover, they usually charge fees for virtual props, which is completely unreasonable. I can pay for a VPS server or pay for a cloud bucket, which actually provides me with valuable services. But to pay for something virtual that only exists in a certain proprietary shitty game? Hilarious! You don't get anything from your money, and it only needs to change a value in its backend to charge you. Paying in gaming is a great disrespect to money, and shows great irresponsibility.

Say, someone displays a number on an HTML page, and when you give him money, the person increases that number the same as the amount of money you give. Does it seem appealing to pay? No. Of course, modern banks are trusted services, and they are considered secure and preserve your money. But literally, any server changing a number in the backend should charge you nothing at all.

This is far more unreasonable than VIPs or Premium Subscription (which most I find unreasonable enough). Paid subscription to a service usually means more usage and more bandwidth costs, etc., so that has a point. But gaming, which gives you absolutely nothing more usually with paid features in terms of costs, is just very unreasonable. Moreover, you can run those services like video tubes and stuff on your own server, whether an old laptop or raspberry pi or a cloud VPS, and spend money wisely. However, gaming relies on the external server, meaning being a slave to the master, which is the gaming company.

Gaming does provide a chance to engage with people. But I think self-hosting is a better option, and then I can invite people to my own servers, where I make the rules. I am generally fine with centralized gaming servers as long as they make the rules clear, which they don't. So in return, what they give you is completely determined by them. You have nothing, they have everything. They can wipe out the account and do whatever they want easily, you are powerless and can only work limited to the buggy frontend.

## About Setting Limits

Bloatwares doesn't stop because you told them to in their shitty frontends. You install a malware and it will always hunger for the resources and try to exploit your system. The same is with gaming. You try to enforce strict restrictions to it systemwide and it complains a million times a day until you remove it.

I set limits to how much time you game a day and my mind doesn't listen. I remind myself to take breaks and I can't. The only way is to tell gaming to f\*\*k off.

## Other kinds of shitwares

There are other kinds of very shitty softwares, that make me very much addicted and is pretty much useless, bloats, that cause all sorts of damage and trouble. It is advised to stay away from them.

Examples include video tubes, crappy social media, etc.

## Why is P\*rn different from Gaming

P\*rn and gaming are substantially different because p\*rn isn't addictive.

I am not saying P\*rn is good for something but come on guys, you don't ma$turb@te over 3 times a day.

## Why Open Source is the solution?

Open source is the solution because it has the source code, granting one control. A person can compile and read the source code, and as a result, the code doesn't dominate the user.

The companies refuse to release the source code for games. This is nonsense. All games shall be open source, and give user the freedom to modify! I want to modify parts of a game myself or tune it, and there is no way but to comply with the company behind it! The company hosts the gaming in its own servers, and who knows if it is secure??? The lack of transparency is at concern.

I am not saying proprietary is bad, or whatever, but to be honest open source is good. I like Google to be honest(LOL).

Also I like binary blobs like Arch Linux Repos, where youc an install stuff quickly with one command. But the fact is that they are open source and compiled in the first place.

## Why are gaming very similar to shitwares(espeically CH!NE$E SHITWARES)?

Shitwares are similar to games in nature. The two share many striking similarities.

Both are very bloated, both require heavy GUI to work.

I don't have one reason to get bloat in the first place, I mean, honestly gaming isn't necessary, so I should uninstall it. Installing bunch of bloat on my computer of phone system is bad in the first place.

With heavy "GUIs"(and crappy, nonfunctional, broked, old, dirty), and no api stuff, both gaming and CH!NE$E SHITWARES are controlling the user, aiming to censor and infect the user and the user's computer/mind! You can't do anything, it isn't free, you pay whatever price company says.

Ch!ne$e shitware companies ask you to identify yourself every 5 seconds. And that's not enough. Shitty A!!pay requires a picture of ID card to log in, and I don't have one with me LMAO.

You have completely no control over the game. It is not something you can master or learn, but the company(or autonomy) decides for you. The company can change the game at any moment, can go malicious. Thus, there is absolutely no point in gaming anyways. You are making a fool out of yourself by gaming.

I really hate stupid guis because they are just mostly unnecessary. Why can't one person control stuff from command line? From python library? From npm library? There shall be enough of those for something to be fun!

## Why is gaming similar to BD$M?

Gaming is like BD$M, and users acts like "SUB", or "M", and companies are "DOM", or "S". The user got tied up and spanked and strangled and chocked, and the company laughs and gets on top of the use, and shits on the user, does whatever they want.

Except BD$M can be actually enjoyable(like in Fifty Shades of Grey seems enjoyable), but gaming can't.

BD$M has "consent" in it, where DOMs don't do everything to subs, instead, they agree on the limits strictly. Say, someone says no to breath-play, so they would agree and not do it. Doing anything more than consent is considered "Rape", and strictly illegal, and shall be subject to jailtime.

Gaming also has "consent" in it, where users would agree to some "terms and conditions" in the before clicking into the game. Except users don't look at the terms and conditions, and usually go through them very quickly. As a result, company can write anything in those terms and conditions, and thus they have endless consent(like sell your data lol).

This is similar to BD$M, where DOMs(usually male) objectify SUBs, and objects can't give consent anyways. So, in the end SUBs(usually female), ends up automatically granting a lot more than suitable. In reality, people neglect those consents, and this makes the SUB very uncomfortable, hurting their lives and causing life-long emotional problems.

Gaming to me is the same. I was pushed into consent by those shitty companies(which are malicious and hope to earn my money). When opening a game, it is like going into the BD$M fantasy. It seem very intriguing to go into but as it continues the SUB is endlessly exploited, deprived of human rights, and will have extremely low self-esteem and life positivity.

Gaming objectifies the user. Javascript games are better because they don't require installing malicious malwares on my computer. But they are malicious(most of them are) anyways.

When you give company endless limits(just no limits), they will try to get as much as they want. User will be chocked, wipped like a slave, kicked and punched, whatever. Users will lose money when company demands it.

I have a lot of emotional distress even now, suffering from gaming from a few years ago. Gaming traumatized my life.

## About Other People

Whether or not other people like gaming is none of my business. People do whatever they want as long as they don't affect me personally. Some people don't feel gaming is taking control over their mind (there are definitely a lot of those people existing), and I admire them for their perseverance because I don't have the endurance to go against gaming long-term. Overall, I have a lack of knowledge about people in the world, so I will just settle here.

As I found out, normal people are incredibly good at controlling themselves from not being overly addicted to gaming. Not me! I am very emotionally weak and at a severe lack of self-control. I am very prune and easily damaged by those gaming stuff. I am not resilient and persistant at all. I am very very weak and vulnerable mentally and emotionally. I am not very competent in handling such stuff(I don't think I will be in the near future, I have a history of not being able to handle stuff like this well).

## Evil Nature

The fact that I cannot quit gaming even though I tried for so many years tells me something about the evil nature of it. Not all games are evil, but at least it contains some very dark instances. Sort of like going into "Myanmar" or "Ukraine" or "North Korea" won't necessarily be life threatening(this is in 2024), but most likely will.

What I can learn is that I gained absolutely nothing from gaming. So it is like the result will always be negative, in fact, having a huge chance of being very negative.

## LibreJS

Perhaps a good way to cope with gaming is to install LibreJS. It is more of a extreme way, but certainly plausible and a measure to be taken in extreme consequences. Doing so will stop users from visiting any of the mainstream sites like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, and be redirected to a libre instance.

I don't use LibreJS now.

However, this is a good way of stopping games altogether because gaming most certainly requires nonfree javascript. So in the end users can live happily under the shield of free and healthy javascript and not be forced to consume those drugs and malicious company based javascript.

## What\'s next? {#whats-nedfdxt}

I gamed for more than 600 hours in the past year(note: this is in Sep 02 2023), that is the equivalent
of losing one half month. I can do so much in one half month (without
taking into account the fact that when I was gaming I was more tired
than usual).

I run out of motivation lately. I couldn\'t stop myself from gaming
lately. Every time I tried to stop gaming, gaming dominated my life even
more.gaming

What should I do next?

**Updates**\
I stopped gaming at October 15th 2023, and it\'s been one month without
gaming at all. It has been very hard, and I faced mental challenges. I
hope I can stay away from gaming forever.

**Updates**\
Something happened and I stopped gaming for a total of 93 days, and resumed gaming on January 16th 2024

**Updates**\
I am determined to quit gaming and embrace a free life starting Apr 7th 2024 again.

**Updates**\
I played video games at 2024.4.28 and 2024.4.29 during emotional breakdown at midnight. I felt so bad.
