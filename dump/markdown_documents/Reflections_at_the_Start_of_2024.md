## Switched to Nanode on Linode {#nanodeSwitch .header}

I considered various cloud services before ultimately settling on Linode
for its simplicity and familiarity. AWS felt overwhelmingly complex by
comparison. I\'ve transitioned from Ubuntu instances in Fremont to
smaller, Nanode Archlinux configurations in Osaka. The allure of
Osaka\'s beauty piqued my interest, despite never having visited
Japan---a trip I aspire to make one day.

## Transitioned to Personal Storage Solutions {#personalStorage .header}

I invested in Linode\'s object storage, even though it\'s pricier than
mainstream options like Dropbox (Linode\'s 1 TB is \$20 compared to
Dropbox\'s 2 TB for \$10). Despite the cost, the open-source nature of
Linode appealed to me. To manage my files, I set up a filebrowser
frontend and a backend with s3fs, which offers an experience akin to
Dropbox.

## Acquiring a VPN {#vpn .header}

Navigating the internet in China necessitates a VPN. Initially, I
experimented with various services on my iPhone and laptop but settled
on Nexitally after dissatisfaction with the speed and performance of
others. A reliable VPN is critical for comfortable browsing and
communication.

## Dealing with Subpar Software {#subparSoftware .header}

I\'ve found much of the software in China frustratingly inadequate. The
Chinese Telecom App, for example, is a source of constant irritation.
There\'s a notable lack of quality, open-source options that allow for
customization. Even a driving car app has proven to be a nauseating
experience.

## Learning to Drive and Dental Plans {#drivingAndDental .header}

Though reluctant, I\'m learning to drive at my parents\' insistence,
spending much of the winter holidays at home for lessons. In addition,
I\'ve begun the process to correct my crooked teeth, which includes the
painful procedure of wisdom tooth extraction.

## Embracing Solitude {#embracingSolitude .header}

I\'ve grown to appreciate solitude, especially away from parental
supervision. My year in the U.S. has led me to a comfortable level of
independence, where I find less need for the familial home. My parents\'
main role has become more about ensuring my adherence to a routine than
companionship.

::: {#minimalistLifestyle .section}
## Adopting a More KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) Lifestyle {#kissLifestyle .header}

My inclination towards minimalism has grown, driving me to eliminate
unnecessary possessions, save for a few cherished items like small
graduation photo books. Concurrently, my dedication to Arch Linux and
its philosophy has deepened.

::: {#timeValuation .section}
## Valuing Time {#valuingTime .header}

As years pass, I\'m reminded of the importance of engaging in meaningful
activities, though procrastination remains a tempting diversion. The
ongoing challenge is to focus on productivity and self-improvement
amidst the distractions.

::: {#gamingQuitting .section}
## Quitting Gaming {#quitGaming .header}

I\'ve abstained from gaming for over two and a half months, a difficult
and often tempting journey. Despite nearing the 90-day milestone often
cited as a turning point, the struggle persists, and I continue to work
towards overcoming the urge to relapse.
