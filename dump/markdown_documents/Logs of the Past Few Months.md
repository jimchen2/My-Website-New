I have lots of strong opinions about stuff, and it is not very helpful or nice to rant in every post, so I am putting all my rant in this post(to be updated kinda frequently). I aim to be as neutral as possible in also posts.

One have opinions naturally, and I found I am expressing my opinions a little to strong these days everywhere, so this is like a centralized place for it.

To start with I am not against any platforms naturally--they are hostile to me in the first place! Those software platforms/apps strongly disrepects their users, providing bad interface and stuff. This post is supposed to be for fun or humor, so don't take it for real.

## Updates 2024.5.15

Ok, I am no longer writing here since sometimes I write on my phones and it is quite inconvenient to write everything here, thus I am archiving these and migrating to Mastodon!


## Updates 2024.5.6

Oh, here I am again. My parents are dictating over my life, like, seriously.

I mean, I was like already 19 years old, and my parents are still trying to make me the prototype the want me to be, it is extremely annoying.

My parents are putting immense pressure on me, not only on studying, but on all aspects of my life. I need to be "not fat", "sleeping regularly", "able to adapt to dorm life(where everybody sleeps irregularly)", "exercising regularly", "eating regularly and properly", "not gaming", "being extroverted", "be extremely good in tech", "be extremely good in school(which sucks)", "not exercise TOO much". These are just some of the extremely contradictory and unhuman standards my parents enforce on me. Now, whenever I violate one of their standards, they start blabbing and bothering me, pushing on every of their measures to make me change. Also, the occasionally threatens to stop giving me money.

Not just to say I am already under immense pressure and feel no urge to consent, but their standards is just impossible to achieve for me, and honestly, I am trying hard enough.

Well, my last time getting back to gaming was entirely their fault, when they pushed me into doing things I didn't want to. I was depressed and there wasn't anything I could do for mental health except gaming again, which lasts 3 months time before I was coming out of the gaming again. They are causing reverse effects, not doing positive for me. The more they are pushing, the more I don't comply.

My parents don't care about my mental health and it was all of them, and they are being very inconsiderate.

As a grown adult I care for myself and I don't need anyone telling me "I am good", or "I am bad", or "I need to change". As long as I am not against the law and I don't bother someone else, I am good the way I am.

Also my parents are very transphobic and homophobic.(though irrelevant)

They are going to the pass the threshold, and I feel not comfortable, and they NEED to stop.

Well, for one thing, I first need to go economically independent, or else I will forever be a slave. How can you argue for anything when you rely on someone's money?

But just to tell you how annoyed I feel, ahh. Like every aspect of my life is watched by someone. They should mind their own business. Are people honestly getting annoying and wanting to affect others when they reach 50 years old?

I felt traumatized freshman year and my parents at that time was reluctant to let me live outside school. I had sleeping problems every night and there wasn't anything I could do except make intensify the conflict the solve the problem. I didn't talk one word all year with my roommates, and it felt extremely annoying to be living with them, ahh. I didn't have any rights. My parents are doing nothing for my wellbeing.

I was being bullyed too much by autonomy and dictation, by those software companies. Being controlled feels horrifying to me. I
did good enough not to drop out of school, but people don't understand that.

I am not a very intelligent person, and I am being overwhelmed by school work alone. They are extremely demanding jobs and requires hours of work, and they are not interesting and appealing anyways.

## Updates 2024.5.5

Some people are saying American is bad, and China is good. Didn't appeal to me though. American may not be very good, but I can't withstand most people's lives in China. Put me in the shoes of 90 percent Chinese and I would freak out, simple as that.

It is a miracle I live healthy till today, especially under the recent illed-guidance of my parents and some mentors.

## Updates 2024.5.4

Why am I not going back to high school?

I am not going back to high school because it sucks. I am not going to somewhere that sucks great shit. If I want to shit, I go behind a tree, or I go to the toilet, but I am never going back to shitty high school.

High school is so shitty it is traumatizing to me to remember that experience.

There ain't no reason to remember high school. High school is jail--teachers are the dominant, students are the submissive. High school is where they rape you and force your consent and brainwashes you and punishes you. High school is where you get locked up 24/7.

If I felt some nostalgia and wanted to go back somewhere it would probably be SMIC school, because that was the place where at least I had fun and didn't hate. Other than that, I would suggest Shibei Middle School, although it is not an ideal place, but, more or less, not overly irritating.

In high school you cram, not study. They force you to eat down the shits of the textbook for reasons to get good in the final exam. Only this doesn't work for me anyways, so like, when I am forced to do something I don't want to do I don't do it.

Also in high school you are sleep deprived. The teachers are autonomy and your daily schedule is very very tight.

Honestly I ain't contributing to the autonomy or dictatership so there I ain't going back to high school anyways. I don't like most of my high school former classmates now, and I try to maintain a reasonable distance. I mean, we can still be friends, after acknowledging the difference. Most of my high school classmates are submissive, and don't care at all about being forced to shit 24/7, there ain't no helping that bro.

High school made me freaking hate Chinese and Chemistry and Biology, probably not again in my life would I get interested in those subjects again, shit.

If I would have a child I would hope for my child to get homeschooled or put somewhere without pressure, to be free and do whatever (they) wanted, like extensively gaming, staying up, being LGBT, whatever. It is not on me to judge someone of something they do.

## Updates 2024.5.2

I don't want to study freakkkk.

I mean, everybody does what they are good at, and I hate studying and going to school more than ever.

I don't want to study anymore but the school requires people to study lol.

If my child(suppose I have one) face the same problem I will kindly say go do whatever you want long as you have decent income.

Maybe being an artist, singer, writer, etc, all more interesting than freaking school.

I got obsessed with music videos these days:\).

Also running seemed to be coming back to me. I love running.

Also, gaming is trying hard to make its comeback to my mind. I had fallend onece some day ago, and aim not to be trapped by this shit later on.

Gaming is the single worst thing you can ever get in life.

Gaming companies are BD$M companies, they trick me into being their little sub.

Except I don't want to be exploited endlessly. I don't wanna die or lose my mind. I am already more or less autistic and having multiple disorders.

## Updates 2024.5.1

3 Things I hate about Hu@we!

- Its phone bootloaders are locked
- Its phone have bloatwares on it
- A phone with LOCKED bootloaders and bloatwares should be sold at more than 100 dollars, except it sells at 1000 dollars.

I don't have any personal opinions about Hu@we! any more than that LMAO.

## Updates 2024.4.24

I am probably not letting my child go to school(given that if I would have a child).

There are many big problems about school, and they are just unnegotiable. For example, some schools require their students to use WeChat. This is very problematic for my child.

Let's picture this scenario. My child goes to school, and is required to use WeChat. Well, problem is, my child might not agree with WeChat's terms and conditions, so it goes against child's moral to use this software, and child believes it to be malicious. The school, obviously, didn't say that everyone must agree to WeChat's terms and conditions when they enter the school, and it is the school's fault that there might be a person who goes into the school but disagrees with using WeChat. Obviously, nor is "everyone must use WeChat" written in the laws, so it's not illegal for someone to refuse. Consequentially, this will be a really big problem. The fact that the terms and conditions exist is reasons not to consent to it.

I am pretty much ok with web based communications like Discord, Whatsapp, but no to WeChat. I am agreeing to WeChat's terms right now because I am being coerced into agreeing by the school, or else it will cause me great discomfort. However, I don't want my child to face the same discomfort in the future.

Also, once I am not coerced into using WeChat, I will not consent to its terms and conditions(I don't even consent now lol), and I believe it is a malicious malware, and refuse to install it on my phone. But it is problematic for my child in school, though. Usually there is a parents group where everyone's parent and the teacher get together to inform some important events and stuff, and I refuse to use that app, so I won't be able to receive notifications. (If given digital freedom I will prefer a PinePhone, but that's another story. Even on Android what if I refuse to download a software?)

Anyways, I am not disagreeing to too much stuff, so much that I can't live. I am still ok with web based communications because that's only like running some javascript in the browser. (I don't even care about nonfree Javascript!) I consent with using a computer, I consent with using a phone, and I consent with pretty much any FOSS softwares! I am consenting too much, not too little! If I don't consent and my child doesn't consent to WeChat, and the school assumes everyone consent to it, then there is no option but to always get into trouble in school!

Another scenario is there is a computer class, and, say, the teacher requires students to work in Windows with a proprietary software, like Keil uVision. Now, I am not saying this software is bad or something, but forcing somebody to work in Windows is against their will. Say, my child doesn't want to do that, and the child asks for alternative tools or open source platforms, or even proprietary blobs in Linux. But the teacher is so stupid and doesn't give him any instructions. Out of anger the child storms out of the classroom, and refuse to take this class.

Well, the obvious consequence to such actions is the child failing this course, and, as a consequence, not being able to advance into the next grade because of "Intellectual Disabilities".

So if in such a scenario the child comes home and asks for my advice, I will say, the teacher is very much uneducated and technical immature--he deserver to be a delivery man more than he deserver to be a teacher(imagine a computer science teacher who doesn't know how to use cli and refuses to answer student's questions??). So obviously I will be backing child up, and child will somehow convey this message to the school classmates/teacher. As a consequence child will be isolated in school, and get really bad grades. People will likely not understand, assuming child is "Inable in Computer Science" or "Just Showing Off or Acting Strange" when child is actually not, child is only refusing to work with a proprietary software / Windows GUI and nothing else.

The child might be proficient in coding in Linux environments, and knows more about computer than the teacher do(who might be a moron in computer science).

An invalid argument is that in some cases, schools may be limited by budget constraints. However, FOSS softwares doesn't require money or budge to download! Their source code is free! Even the downloading bandwidth is free. There will only be budget constraints for the proprietary softwares! Also, there can be existing curriculums in school, but the school should always allow(or provide adequate documentation) for those seeking an alternative way.

Yet another scenario is the Chinese exams. The child fails in the Chinese exams(in China they are really hard), and come home crying, saying "I" have been criticized by the teacher. Well, what shall I do? In such a scenario I believe that the child is doing enough to take that exam in the first place, and not having a word of complaint beforehand. But those Chinese exams are boring as hell, and so is the Chinese class, and you cannot increase the scores by hard work, instead, they are usually predetermined and the teacher just don't like the answers of some students(even if they have adequate reasons to backup), and gives them low scores.

Of course I don't care a damn about Chinese exams, but the school might do, and the child might be in great trouble if child keeps failing in those exams, getting far behind the average score. As a result, child might be left out among child's peer classmates, and be perceived as "queer".

There are more scenarios to think about. Another scenario is the child is LGBTQ+, and in some schools, girls can be objectified and perceived as partnering with a boy, contrarily, boys might be taught to marry a girl in the future. Well, what they don't realize is that there is a mass group of homosexual people, and I believe they deserve their rights! If two girls like each other, or two boys like each other, then let them be! Some teachers in teaching, might mistakenly try to create a close bond between different sex that is usually problematic.

Moreover, some child might refuse to be classified, e.g. non-binary. Other might be not interested in sex at all, e.g., asexual. The school fails to represent those groups of minority.

Thus modern schools have too many serious problems, and poses significant challenges if my child goes into it(given that I would have a child in the first place). I would rather my child go pursue a career of athletes, like figure skating, gymnastics, distance running, etc, or, alternatively, try to be a ballet dancer, violinist, painter, philosopher, pianist, etc, than going into the traditional school.

Moreover, I don't feel I have enough time to homeschool my child for around 15 years. If my wife refuse too(say, I have a wife, and we discuss about such matter), choices are to not have a child at all than assuming the child will adapt to traditional school.

## Updates 2024.4.22

I am in that crappy embedded system again!!! Freaking!!!

Anyways, today Alipay wasn't agreeing with me. I don't want to expand. All I can say is Alipay is a very malicious app, MALICIOUS indeed! I am so tired now and a little hungry. So I downright removed Alipay from my phone LMAO.

Nexitally requires Alipay(?so as I thought then maybe I will be switching to another company?)

Alipay's program sometimes acts like an endless loop. You go through it and it starts looping, and it never responds or return valuable information.

Alipay's mini program is so buggy. It responds with a extremely high lag, and frequently errors without any clear messages. 12306 is a shitty program.

Anyways, I shall stop ranting I am very very tired.

## Updates 2024.4.21

I didn't know I have to rant this much! Freaking! But it does seem I am a bit overwhelmed these days.

So it is official that I lost the battle against Android. I am not using a Linux phone right now, nor will I be doing that in the near future. The reasons:

1. LineageOS Works Fine. Linux Mobile doesn't(bad browser experience and having so many problems)
2. LineageOS is degoogled(except for GBoard)
3. I am losing too much time flashing devices.
4. I rely on Android anyways(WeChat)

Today WeChat recommended a prostitution ad to me, so Fu\*k You WeChat,

So yeah, the basic conclusion is Linux mobile is worse in terms of usability and convenience than LineageOS(the citical factor is calling, lol), and I am against using Proprietary operating systems for like calling stuff only(Even if it's simple). LineageOS is open source and pretty customizable, it just lacks a traditonal cli like Linux.

I am very sad indeed and looked at phones 10 years ago, which gave me lots of nostalgia. I remembered clearly those times where I used cash to do stuff and they gave me much more control. I didn't have a smartphone until 2020 and I didn't use it extensively until late 2022. I couldn't but feel a deep sense of remorse and just literally helplessness right now.

WeChat is more or less a malware stuff, and I hate it so much. I refuse to go on 3rd party apps. I try to refuse as much as I can. I lost this fight, there is nothing I can do about it, and that is the end of stuff.

I started to listen to sad love songs, not for a girl in my mind, but for nostalgic feeling.

## Updates 2024.4.16

The political teacher is very annoying, and the politics class is very annoying.

It is not annoying in the traditional way, like politics course in middle school where they try to stuck those ideas into your mind. Instead, the teacher is frequently touching sensitive topics, and "suggesting stuff", it's very annoying.

I don't dare to talk one thing bad about Winnie in China because otherwise I would be jailed for life and tortured to death. I try to be as apolitical as possible to maintain a neutral stance. If you don't do anything chances are you won't be arrested in China.

Anyways, especially those senseless talks in the group, and the teacher frequently touching those topics annoyed me. Someone said WeChat facced sanctions, and suggested opening a Telegram Group for "chatting in freedom", and wanted to talk about the tanks in Beijing. I almost bursted out "if you want to open a gropu why not open a matrix or Libera Chat instead of like Telegram", but controlled myself not to talk anything in the politics class group.

Well, people are talking about politics when they rely on proprietary software, lmao. They can't life the sanctions off their head and they are talking about politics? Hilarious! Imagine, losers.

Anyways, politics is just annoying, everything about it is very bothering to me, and I really hate it or discussing it. I consider myself more aligned with libertarianism(but not 100 percent libertarian, more like non-party). I also consider myself a open source software advocate(not Free software, though, I rely too much on some non-Free softwares, FSF is too incompatible with modern living standards).

Computer science stuff simply appeal to me more than fu\*king gaming or Winnie, and I can't care less about politics, lol. I hate this fu\*king politics class more than a boring politics class.

## Updates 2024.4.15

Well today I am going to that class again, and holy crap! I installed stm32cube on my laptop, but I could not figure out how to use it. Anyways, they packed those .bat files and everything generated, I am speaking, literally, in the folder.

There was no way for me to figure things out except use crappy Windows, and I don't understand why I would be punished this harshly just attending a shitty general class. I mean, like using Windows feels like torture.

I kind of wished I had selected any course other than this because this is just a piece of shit everything here.

If I hadn't attended Embedded system course in Berkeley, I would be very annoyed at embedded systems. Although I didn't get a good grade back there, at least it made me very very interested in everything embeded related, including Linux phones and stuff and all of those, Arduino, etc. But the hostility of this course and the systems and the software, ahh, everything, made me wanna throw up.

Alright, the kind kind teacher came and try to install it for me, but he failed miserably, after messing around with Windows crappy shitty GUi，trying to navigate his way through the messay GUI, couldn't figure it out as well, and try to generate a keys(a software needs keys to use?shouldn't it be released open sourced?)

Anyways, a student came by and stated he could do it in vscode for me, and he tried and bundled with it a bit, and it needs a exe path. Of course it is by no means available on my own computer, (the freaking keil extension isn't available in the first place anyways in OSS Code), so like after that he said he needed to go and left without a fix for the problem.

So I was stuck with broken IDEs. I tried to ask for him to do it in cli but he said he hadn't known cli before, so I am greatly puzzled and distressed. Then like he left without a clear message, and the windows desktop shortcuts no longer opens lmfao.

Well before I only heard windows is bad for setting up environment and many people recommend it in Debian based distros, but this is the first time someone tells me I could only do something in Windows, and refuses to use cli. He said he doesn't know how, and I strongly question his skills and ability. I said I use Linux, he was like "what is Linux? I don't know Linux", which is almost like for a baby "I don't know how to walk please tell me".

Anyways after that the teacher came and reattempted to install the software for me, only failing miserably again, and he was digging through the messy stupid gui. I went online to that website and attempted to download an exe(exes splash files all over the place it messes up the whole computer), but I couldn't find anything valuable through the messy frontends.

I kept saying I like cli and offered the stmcube IDE. However, the teacher said he didn't know and haven't used that tool lmfao. He didn't know how to use cli either.

Windows is just a bloated mess when it comes to softwares, and when it is actually installing stuff it gets really stinky, and it just DONT work, period.

The website has a http (very insecure, fraudulent suspected!), and there is no way to access it. There are several 1000 pages info pdfs(expect me to read wtf?).

Anyways, the teacher went off to another group to check them off, then he went back and continued attempting to install it for me. I mumbled thanks now and then, and the teacher said he would send me the key to me in QQ. Ahh, I am so amazed by such a patient person! If it was me I would give up the installation process in half a minute!

Then the teacher send the code to me in QQ! I am honestly after all this crap I am no longer even angry lmao. And he made it work! After 1 hour of hard work finished installing!

## Updates 2024.4.8

So something extremely annoying happened in the embeded system class.

Actually this class isn't even a major class, it's for general public. I had already taken grad Embeded systems in Berkeley.

In the class I had no idea what to do and I had no idea how to do it. I am just struck with loads of confusion and frustration, adding to this painful day.

So what happened was that the teacher made us do some `experiments` with a board, and I had no idea what the fu\*k to do. No one else had a problem! Only me! I am serious!

The teacher asked students to download something called `keil µVision`. It is start of a nightmare to work with this shitty thing. It doesn't even support Linux, and I was like what? Well it is my first time I actually had a problem with a software not supported in Linux though.

Anyways, I was like, well, this gotta be hard. Truth is, the software so called `keil µVision` is both proprietary and has a very very complicated ui that I have no idea what to do with it. There are windows computers in the lab but using them is just very very painful, and agasint my morals. I would refuse and fight against the piece of rot.

Well, what struck me is how much trouble I would encounter with so called "general education" computer science course.

I like to control things with cli, problem is, working in windows literally made me disgusted.

Virtual machines are also painful and bloat, especially running a crapware like shitty Windows, which occupies hundreds of Gigabytes for no purpose at all. I mean, running a Linux VM is good enough, but windows, well, that's another story altogether.

I tried to ask the teacher, turns out teacher doesn't know, or isn't familiar with Linux.(Teacher isn't familiar with Google Lmao) It is like my first time facing an actual incompatibility problem in Linux. Anyways, I quickly decided not to use the shitty vision IDE.

Well I scanned the QR code on the back of the dev board, and it opened up a website with all resources in BaiduNetDisk. Turns out baidu is in my blacklisted websites, so lol.

Also BaiduNetDisk requires downloading its rotten malware app to be able to download just anything to my device, and it completely disrespects and bullies its users. Baidu is a company that's autonomous and tries every means to dominate its users, just like in those typical bd$m movies where man dominates and objectify a woman, except the user takes the role of woman here.

For a moment I got really thankful I went to Berkeley for a year. I never thought like that before. In my year in Berkeley I was miserable, struggling mentally and academically. Now looking back, I found the year valuable in many ways, at least it is much more meaningful than wasting time here in China. Honestly I never learned one thing about computer science in USTC, I mean not one thing at all. All I learned here previously (before I visited Berkeley) is computer science is a terrible thing, and I better stay away from it.

Stallman expressed: "All things learned in Education shall be free softwares!" Well you know what? Here is a class where I am required to use nonfree softwares(and use Windows! I am scared).

I started to really missing the `Lingua Franca` program I used in Berkeley for Pololu. I started missing my Raspberry Pi. I got no idea why people would design shit like this for me. I know I had done many evils, like eating animals or whatever, but why do I have to bear with shit softwares? I am better off dead.

Then I finally downloaded the example code after like unzipping a million layers. Even the folder is a complete mess--they zip it multiple layers, you know? I was like What the Freak? They zipped it and included those generated files, and included a million projects with generated files for each in one folder, and it isn't even available anywhere in GitHub or something. Honestly it look every bit like piece of malware or softwares like primary school students would be digusted to write.

The files are mostly generated by the crappy "keil vision" software. It is like, well, imagine uploading all the node modules everywhere you go, or a HuggingFace Model with Pytorch environment packed with every python script. And it is not a personal project, which can be forgiven for ignorance or lack of time to organize. Come on, it's a commercial product.

There is also a website `https://prechin.net/` written on the back of it. Turns out this website is dangerous and I need to click through the dangers to proceed. It's no difference than a scam website that says your computer is infected with virus and asks for bitcoins. The frontend looks like a piece of crap to me. Why don't they just run a discourse if they don't want to manually code everything?

Any software that works exclusively on Windows is pure garbage. I am liberal enough and I am not against proprietary softwares, but being both proprietary and working solely on a os that dominates its users, man!

There are certain softwares that work only on Windows, turns out they can't work.

Well, what can I say about them? They have every last bit of bad practices in everything, code, website. Ahh, I would trust a homeless person more than the shitty company, and the shitty class.

Those people even included "open source" in their website title. So Shameless!

Anyways, after finally extracting the files I try to write a makefile to make it work. But it kept failing, constantly complaining about the file (a library). Obviously the teacher doesn't know how to debug. He doesn't know how to use Linux lmao.

So that was the end of class, and I got kind of scared.

## Updates April

### Thinking about 6d$m

**Tags**: `morality`

Lately I have been thinking about 6d$m. I am intersted in comparing maledom and femdom.

I find watching CBT or scat fetish deeply disgusting and disturbing. I couldn't think why a sane man would want to be submissive like that? It seems very painful and dirty.

Then I thought about like the female's perspective on male domination, and I wonder if they think the same way. Most adult videos are targeted towards females, and for male satisfaction. So I wonder if female would find the male domination disturbing and disgusting like I do for femdom. These womans are treated really harshly, that's all I can say.

And actually I think male dominations is objectification of females. I don't care that much about legality, but just starting from a morality point of view, male domination always reminds me of the patriarchy society. It's kind of dehumanizing to females who are powerless. Males are born to be stronger on average than females, and the domination and submissive can't help but remind me of something very nasty.

I mean, at least like morally I find gaydom or lezdom or femdom to be acceptable. But maledom, though previously I didn't find it disturbing or bad, seems to me like a problem more and more. Is it morally correct to do so? If 6d$m is an objectification of woman, then how do the dom follow the consent, since objects doesn't give consent? Isn't the woman more forced and coerced at some point, or always sacrifying herself to satisfy the male desire in 6d$m? Remember, consent doesn't always justify one's doings. Somebody can give a consent when he or she is starving, or drunk, or unable to pay the rent, but that obviously doesn't justify like your doings.

There is a certain difference between maledom and femdom. Femdom is not as inherently morally questionable as maledom, since male are usually the stronger person. Femdom is not that harmful, since sexual harrasement happens more than 99% to woman. Homosexual 6d$m is also not inherently wrong, since it is more like focusing solely on roleplaying, and tend to be more equal in terms of power.

While I don't oppose consensual sex between partners or adults engaging in activities like couple's intimacy, threesomes, or portraying homosexual relations in videos, I find the depiction of 6d$m to be more controversial. 6d$m frequently shows women in bondage and submissive, begging positions. This can stimulate predatory and violent tendencies in male viewers by reinforcing the image of women as subordinate objects for male dominance and consumption. With the widespread prevalence of such content, the portrayal of bounded, serving women as fodder for male sexual appetites becomes a concerning norm.

Is there some female who would be willing to work for 6d$m in adult industry? Yes, of course. If the industry brings enough money, certain woman are willing to sacrifice their health or dignity, even if they already have foods and shelter. There are lots of these woman out there, actually willing to perform and be portrayed in those adult films as subs.

But does an individual's consent inherently justify the portrayal of 6d$m? No, I don't believe it does. There are certainly people willing to engage in various unethical or harmful acts purely for amusement's sake, such as recreational drug use or participating in gore videos for money. A fully consented 17 year old couple cannot post their sex videos online. And without legal protections, there would undoubtedly be many underage individuals coerced into sex work despite their perceived "consent." The existence of consent alone, even without financial desperation as a factor, does not automatically provide moral justification for an action.

Honestly I don't care what couples do in their bedrooms. They do whatever they want. Child porn is not allowed but underage people are allowed to have sex. Couples are even do gore in their bedrooms, totally fine. The problem lies in the normal social perception of 6d$m, and I believe it should have a far stricter and cautious approach.

Consent alone does not necessarily make something ethical if it normalizes or perpetuates societal attitudes and power dynamics that can be dehumanizing or harmful. Imagine depicting and promoting femdom involving CBT or scat fetish, which, I think is dehumanzing the male, I would be utterly disgusted by the image. But for the counterpart, isn't doing the same thing to female disgusting and unacceptable?

As for myself, I find it some 6d$m morally questionable, but that remains to be debated, as these questions doesn't have a clear definitive answer yet.

### Thinking about Freedom

**Tags**: `freedom`

Today I was thinking about what I wanted to do in my life in the future, and I thought about like PhD degree and being a professor or whatever, but more like, I don't have any potentials to think about my future life right now.

I am not free. I am constantly controlled and manipulated by my parents, and I am in the giant pool of anxiety and depression and inconfidence. I was in that condition as long as I left middle school, not that middle school is good or whatever. I clearly remembered happy for a bright future when I was walking around in Green City after 9th grade. But everything was but my hope(not things are bad or whatever, they are just, unreasonable). Ever since I entered high school, I felt into the swarm of depression and anxiety, and I couldn't get out.

I think that I must first strive for 4 freedoms before thinking about a clear goal in my life(because all I can think about is these 4 freedoms right now).

The first freedom is freedom of time. This literally means I must have a substantial amount of time for myself. This doesn't mean I won't be studying for that long, instead, it means I get the freedom to decide whether I want to study or not for a substantial amount of time. I get to decide whether to study or play or sleep or stay up all night, given that I don't distract others. That is not ideal for now, but quite close.

The second freedomm is freedom of choice. I get to decide things, and I get to keep my preferences. If I prefer sommething, people don't "friendly advise" me to do otherwise. This friendly advise is usually strong coersion. If I don't like something, fine, long as it doesn't affect others, I get to keep it as I want. If I have a strange hobby that many people find unreasonable, fine! Actually I don't care about the choice for foods or room that much, but I don't care doesn't mean I don't have the right to care. If I want to watch porn, fine!(not that I want to watch porn) If I want to play video games for 24 hours straight and given I can care for my health, fine! If I dislike living in a dorm, and I don't distract others when living alone, then I don't live in a dorm, and no questions asked. I have the freedom to choose! This is not ideal for now, primarily because my parents keeps "friendly coercing" me to do contradictory things all the time, constantly mocking and threatening even, making me very tense. I don't dislike my parents, they are good guys. But they need to stop impacting my choices, and they are becoming annoying now at this.

The third freedom is digital freedom. This includes using open-source softwares. I don't support Richard Stallman's views 100%, especially his free softwares. I find open-source softwares good enough, and I think more importantly I need to have control over the software. WeChat, in particular, is a malware, and crawls slowly into the user's mind and dominates the user. It is not only a malware in the phone, but also a malware in the user's brain. WeChat makes users depend on it, depriving them of control, and constantly brainwashes its users, just like many other Chinese platforms. When I start using WeChat I would spend a far substantial time online doing all sorts of completely meaningless activities. The easiest way to achieve digital freedom is to use PostMarketOS for smartphone, and lock LineageOS Redmi Phone is a box, and only open it seldomly for doing necessary stuff. This is not ideal, but pretty close too.

The fourth freedom is self-sufficiency. I need to support myself without depending on my parent's money. This is important because if I depend on them, then I need to listen to their advices. They have the power over me. The problem is my parents are getting increasingly misleading, and gives contrary and wrong ideas in many aspects of my life, and they want to control my life in their hands. Well, if I go self sufficient I will have a much stronger voice when not listening. I am already an adult, if I commit a crime I need to take full respoonsibility of it, so why shouldn't I take full responsibility of other aspects of my life? Also, if I don't want to live in a dorm and my parents does, and I go self-sufficient, then I can go live in wherever I can afford, and I can give no specific reasons for my behaviors. This is far from being satisfied since I have no income now. I need to have a stable income, and constantly support myself, not that my family is poor, but just to illlustrate that I can.

So I hope for these to be true in the PostGrad period. If I got ththoseose things satisfied, then I can try thinking about my life's goals or aims. Without these, all that's in my head is the enormous endless depression and anxiety when I think about such things.

### Freedom -- the the Starting Point in Life's Meanings

There are many times when I started thinking about what to do, and it ultimately boils down to what is life's true purposes. And it took me many days trying to figure it out, and I am still failing.

But the starting point is freedom, in self-control. Freedom in 3 ways- physical and digital freedom, time freedom, and freedom of choice.

Without freedom there is no talking about whatever meanings of life is. I am not willing to sacrifice freedom for any achievements(partially like a few weeks, yes, in long terms, no).

Many ambitious goals **ROB** me of freedom, and that's what got me undetermined.

Without freedom and self-sufficiency, I do believe that life is without its meanings, and I would rather prefer doing nothing than achieving anything.

### Reflecting on the Previous Troubles I got into

I got into encounters of trouble on the Internet during the ages of 16-17.

1. Spamming messages on a military education website
2. Cursing the teacher(in so-called anonymous platforms)
3. Being alleged of cheating in competitive programming(helping out a teammate who constantly complains about not being able to read English to translate in Microsoft word, which is alleged "cheating" since Internet access isn't allowed, but the competition is online, which is complicated, and the person was only using Microsoft word)

Well, the three situations share a common trait, which is it's on a proprietary platform and I was using shitty Microsoft. In short, by anonymizing myself on the Internet(obviously not believing in those so-called anonymous features after logging it????), probably using tor or several vpns or whatever, and switching to libretranslate if possible?(although I myself didn't have any problems with English but I "guided" a teammate to use shiity Microsoft Word for translating to Chinese, and the situation exploded and the whole school was banned because of this "cheating", although I didn't know about it in its rules)

That said, it definitely shouldn't be **me** to offer help on proprietary platforms like shitty Windows. I mean I can work literally seamless in probably all Linux distros and Rasp Pi, other other systems and cloud hosting and cloud gpus, and maybe half of Android and LineageOS platform problems, but proprietary platforms like shitty Windows is just not my taste. There are lots of powershell experts out there, who probably don't know what Linux is but are awfully proficient working on those proprietary platforms. Ask them for help. I won't provide anymore help on Windows, nor do I know how to use it aside from like browsing web? I can do nothing but mess up this crappy system.

That said, although my purpose of using Linux is KISS, being simple small secure whatever, Linux is certainly good for designing and suitable for someone who prefers heavy art. Just save the dot files or try to customize KDE Plasma for a MAC experience, or whatever. Doing those beauty is not my cup of tea, I prefer a simple intuitive desktop, period.

I was a little paranoid after the situations, and started deleting social media accounts after that. As of now I pretty much deleted all my social media accounts except for necessary ones like WeChat and QQ. I usually have some extremist thoughts that could be categorized as inappropriate, other times I just natually wanted to do some experiments, like spamming messages, whatever. I can do whatever I want in like, a self-hosted platform like discourse or mastodon say whatever I want. I deleted like Instagram and Vkontakte accounts one year later. After all, I just want to be invisible for the proprietary platforms.

Also, another problem is that even if many people are saying inappropriate things, I shouldn't follow them because I might be more extreme.

Back to the topic of judging whether these are moral. Firstly, spamming, I think, is moral if not explicitly against a platform's term of service. However, it's best to avoid those troubles, especially in Chinese platforms, since you need to do more than moral in this world. It is not my morals that stop me from doing many things, but instead, a way to avoid troubles. Secondly, I think cursing is not moral at all, given that cursing have no real effects and it's just, well bad. However, what the teacher did to my grades was clearly unfair, and, as a child at that time I couldn't do anything. Is that moral? I don't know, I mean, it is justifiable from the teacher's perspective, but it was still too much for me mentally to bear at that time. That said, I will probably go crazy if I go into some conscription or military camps or even in high school, I mean it, and there wasn't any helping at that time. So given my lack of mind and control, I think cursing people isn't such a big deal from my perspective, just don't do it on those school platforms, because if the school decides to take serious actions like expelling me it's just not worth it.

Thirdly, I do think my action is 100 percent moral and within the rules, and it is just that this competition is too crappy, and there were no rules being told beforehand, and I didn't go online intentionally. So it's best to avoid those stupid competitions after all if they are practically unoffical and useless. That said, there wasn't any helping to do for this thing, and I was lucky USTC didn't expell me, only letting me write a whole paper for the situation. I kept realizing that even if going to university is like a shitpile then USTC is probably the cleanest and most liberal ones among them.

### Reflecting on the Telephone Fraud

I remembered the telephone fraud that happened about 8 months ago. I am summarizing and reflecting on it.

1. A person calls me claiming to be Chinese embassy person. He says I was involved in a fraud crime, and hope I could go there for a visit to clarify(I am annoyed), and I was going to class, and he asked to call me back a few minutes later
2. He called me back, and claming something more serious, and claming I would be sent back to China. He asked to try letting a "policeman" talk on the phone for this matter.
3. A "policeman" got on the phone, claiming he is "official" by changing some digits of the telephone number. (I believed and thought it was a little bit of trouble). Then he started talking to me for long hours about what I did and what consequences I would face(I actually nearly believed)
4. He kept talking to me the same words again and again, and I got super scared. He then asked to use Skype, and asked for my bank credentials and id card number and passport number, which I told him. Essentially the scare is what got me. He had total control over me when I am scared. So, getting scared makes me vulnerable.
5. I called my parents by excusing to go to bathroom, then my parents told me he was fraud, and I deleted him. In the end nothing was stolen, only I wasted a whole night.

Some things to take in mind:

1. Never admit to anything I didn't do. Be firm and learn to fight back mentally. Everyone knows I am innocent. Learn to fight the authority, this is critical for freedom. (even to policeman, don't treat them like shit).(never ever ever get involved to drug cartels or prostitutes or child porn or politics in real life, if I got involved then these crimes might actually be a reality, although for such news, I am still very curious into what exactly happened. The worst things I can do is probably throwing trash on the ground or improper citations or jaywalking)
2. Stay to principles and don't download unnecessary softwares for other people. If necessary go use it on other machines. This is hardest, because, at my age such things are extremely stimulating to the mind.
3. Never believe officials "calling"
4. No one is prune to frauds! Always act with some caution(not necessarily so much but still don't act arrogant), and many frauds can't get to me

Some thoughts about policeman:

1. I never had one encouter with policeman in my life besides going to police station for id cards or something.
2. Policeman are not authority, especially individual ones.
3. Try complying if encoutered, but at least be mentally strong
4. Policeman catch bad people. If I commit a serioud crimme I will probably be bought to justice, but in certain situations certain people commit certain crimes, which police chooses to ignore(although everybody knows)

That said, there are countless illegal acts in both China and America. Sensible police obviously browse the Internet and knows, but they don't catch the criminals, even if they know who they are.

This is probably because:

1. criminals are cunning, justifying their acts in ridiculous ways
2. criminals might have **certain** relationship to police
3. police **just** doesn't catch these kind of crimes, (it is usually an action not encouraged and not that bad, although illegal, and police will try to handle those cases if they are explicitly reported or affecting a very large scale, but on individual cases police doesn't care)

There are other reasons I don't know. In conclusion as a sane citizen it is best for me to get away from politics, Winnie, drug cartels, prostitution, policeman, etc.

### Buying Gifts or Sending Money to strangers

I nor want to receive money or expensive gifts nor have the ability to send money or expensive gifts right now.

As you can see currently I am using my parents money, so beyond the basic living I have literally no money at all, which means anyone with money left in their purse is richer than me. In the futuer I plan to always buy phones less than 200 dollars(maybe with inflation go higher). Iphone is not attractive in any ways. It turns out the most luxurious thing I have is my laptop.

Say I change laptop every 2 years, that probably adds around 50-100 dollar to my monthly budget.

Other things I either inherit it from parents (which I will probably stop after a few years), or are very cheap, typically below 50 dollars. There is nothing as expensive as the laptop. The most expensive thing is about 1/20 the price of a pricey laptop(cheap laptops like chromebooks or ARM computers might be 300 dollars, but they aint optimal for daily driver). I can probably buy a 400-500 dollar computer if budget comes tight, which equates to 20 dollars a month if used 2 years, cheaper than a normal lunch in San Francisco.

Just as you can see, right now I am in the state of being **feed** by my parents, which means my parents can determine how much money I have. My parents are **usually** generous, but it doesn't mean they will forever give money to me. After university I plan to not take any more from them. Literally this means all money I spent needs to be consented by my parents, what's more, pretty much everything I do would be consented by my parents. Although my parents are also generous about my decisions and giving pretty much full consent with default settings, I am still not free, kind of like I am not "sudo" user in my computer.

Of course I need more money than a mere 500 dollars each month if I am to feed a family. It is better to have some emergency money in my hands. Also a child is far far more costly, and normally people have children at age 30(I don't know if I will though, or ever), also at around age 30 my parents go into 60s, meaning they probably will spend some money for health reasons.

It is obvious to save some budget, though I don't know how much is suitable. You can't save all money and not spend them, which is ridiculous. But it is highly unlikely I will have some money right now, and spending those few thousands of dollars(if I ever can earn) for a small-scale traveling seems pretty suitable.

But for right now at least, I am using my parents money, which makes sense not to send any money to anyone. I mean llike 10 or 20 RMB sometimes can be lost by accident occasionally, like if the metro stops for a day and using the taxi costs more than that. But only occasionally, and over 1000 RMB should be cautious when treating.

### Motivation?

What drives me forward? What makes my life meaningful?? Obviously not studying some crappy subject in school, right? But aren't I dependent on the diplomas? I am not free in this sense, where I depend on some shit to get my diploma, and had to study and work like a shit. However, I am still geniuely grateful for USTC, because, among the trashpile, you are the less annoying one. At least USTC helped me realize many things that otherwise I couldn't think of, and, in that sense, is some liberty,

Sorry for the selffishness but beyonds enhancing my life and gaining some sort of control over it there is no other purpose of life that I could think of. Some great people live in poor standards for many years, and it's probably not gonna happen for me. If I am going to live in those poor conditions, I would rather try to go in a better situation than being literally stuck. There isn't any meanings in your life if you die, and meanings diminish if your wellbeing diminishes. I am not dreaming of a person who have billions of dollars but needs to be in bed for covid every single day, till his death. There is no point in being poor in the first place.

I think I am out of poverty right now, although being arrogant is against my philosophy. Anyways, I can probably freelance for 1 or 2 days a week and be self-sustained in lower ends towns and cities. I wouldn't give up the basic living conditions or my health for selflessness, for research, or for just anything, or anyone.

### So it seems like loneliness was a problem after all?

Playing proprietary games, looking at unnecessary proprietary trash social media, watching adult videos, all of these, are these unavoidable?

I thought loneliness could be handled without complaints but after all, it seems like a serious mental problems, seemingly with no ways to cope against.

Loneliness leads to idealizing the society, and people around me.

But socializing seems so complicated and hard to implement, all at the same time? How did I not find some close friends through all those difficult years? Or, is it because I lost trust in seemingly everything, that I decided to, take a turn back towards the nighttime?


## Updates February

### Melancholy Night

This melancholy night reminds me again of the numerous occasions of beginning of semester scenario throughout my middle school career, and yet, even over the years, still lost and helpless am I.

It is a common practice to feel a little nostalgic, whilst when asked, do I want to return to the past? I would probably refuse.

Back to the days where I would play video games for hours in the summer, then go to the library to try hard studying, making my own goals, trying to accomplish, afraid of schools yet it's always coming, going. Back to the days where in the final exam I would be so anxious and play video games the whole day before the afternoon exam at home, and fear the hear my scores. I would walk and dream of the world as mine, and with the lighest and purest heart, appreciate the beauty of the night-lights in the urban areas of Shanghai.

I would make a comprehensive studying plan, only breaking down half way usually to go off playing video games. I would try to push myself forward, and read lots of literature, pretending they are of great knowledge. I would hope for the school to end, and dream of the future after middle school.

I would go crying and exclaiming about the whole world around me, howling into the uttermost darkness, or the brighest summertime with sizzling sun, or just a mediocre spring day. I would ill at the loneliness, and long for a companion, yet seeing none my age. I would treat the external world the way I saw it around me, and naught the distractions on the Internet nor what's happening in the world would cause the slightest hint of thought. I had no idea, and so there is no bother.

I lived the life of school day after day, as if it was of some importance and greatness. I was strict about the goods and bads, and I would start tackling those matters one by one. It was hard, yes, the uneasiness of puberty, the urge of sex, the sensitivity of the fragile mind. Yet, hard as it might, and ultimately, I would try shaping myself into the person I wanted, trying to strictly define the thing, and hope all the light in the future.

So I hoped, and I dreamed, and everything was shattered.

It wasn't until recently did I realize I lived in some kind of mockery nearly all my life, and naught did I know my purpose back then. I lived for other people, and it goes against my mind. My efforts weren't for my own purposes--they were forced. And thus, did this system crumble, and breaked were my mental mind and philosophy. This system simply leads nowhere, and nor did I know what to strive for. Ending in a difficult situation am I right now, and completely dazzled and frustrated, losting his way in the path going to nowhere.






### External Brainwash vs Internal Control

Internal Control is an inevitable method to gain control of myself over the external environment, while also restricting the mind. External Brainwash is the environment affecting the my minds and thoughts, causing (bad) influences.

I don't care whether these are good or bad influences and it turns out they aren't all beneficial, and it is costing my freedom.




### Control vs Brainwash

Being externally brainwashed is the worst thing that could ever happened, and I found that I was being brainwashed nearly all my life. I still don't have an idea about pretty much anything.

I don't feel like being in control, and moreover, I feel desperate.

### My Parents don't know nothing

Following my parent's advice is really stupid act, and they only make me conform to their ideals.

Turns out that their idea is outdated and nonapplicable.

Undeniably my parents was doing well back in 20 or 30 years ago, and maybe even today in their own fields, but they know nothing about me.




### Oh 2018 seems something of the past

I remembered like in 2018 I was longing for my primary school? Fifth grade life? Whatever????

Anyways, 2018 is something long gone now.

I used to play youkia's pvzol though. 

Oh, how time files, these years, I had barely had a grasp before things were turning wheels and flying.




### How I had failed in controlling Gaming

I couldn't control nothing in my life. Somehow I wished I would go for grad school here in USTC. I really don't mind it and also I am kind of having enough of this total nonsense of anxiety.



### A Strange Dream

Yesterday, I dreamed back to high school again.

First I went back to a dorm where people sleep in the same bedsheet, and it was super smelly. I wanted to get out, but couldn't, and thought that was the dorm I must facce in my high school.

There was the final exam, and I prepared really hard and thought I had tried my best for it. However, there was going to be an annoucement of Chemistry scores, and the same dreaded and creepy feeling came all over me again that it was gonna be really horrible. 

Then I thought for the millionth time which subjects do I choose. Precisely at that point I even lost account of the fact that I finished high school. I thought I'd choose physics and geology for sure, as 3 subjects were required, but then I needed to choose another among the Chemistry, Biology, History, and Politics, and I got super nervous and anxious.

I thought back to choosing History for a moment before realizing how awful I performed on the subject, but there wasn't much other choices, since my Chemistry and Biology are much worse.

Then I sort of faded back into unconsciousness, and woke up.



### Why browser extension redirects doesn't work?

You either go on or you don't go on these websites. It is a conscious choice, and hard to confuse. 

If you don't go on, fine, nothing is needed--you just actively go away from lures. 

If you decides to go on, there is no stopping that action from a browser extension--simple.

Furthermore a buggy browser extension offers far more disaster than this.





### Dedication

Studying requires lots of dedication, and no easy distractions.


### Need to Work Harder

I am seriously not putting in enough efforts for studying now. I need to work harder and push forward instead of falling back and gaming, no excuses. **###FocusStudying###StudyHarder###NoMoreExcuses**


### Telegram still Impacting????

Seriously Telegram is *JUST HARMFUL* app full of illegal content, and they are consuming and not beneficial. So quit Telegram and embrace life!



### NO NOTICE on GAMING

I've said countless times that I need to stop freaking gaming. Gaming IS serious and it is really the main reason for lack of control. So value your freedom and stay away from the crap!



### GIrl on Internet??

Why are you actually developing a crush over some prostitues you see in an adult video?? There are so many more beautiful girls in real life and these porn sluts, they are just UNSUITABLE for me?? It is both ridiculous and not logical at all to have such a strange thought.

Never depend on someone else for my own life, and dominatrix is just a piece of shit?? Do you want to be masochist being played by another femdom? It's both ridiculous and completely piece of shit. Cherish your free life! Be sensible!

At the same time be sensible to never touch those porn people, or else having some sexual relationship might impact my whole life. 

I am not banning porn or sex but it is just too much, the level of emotions on watching adult videos.

In fact I am also imposing a ban on adult videos from now on. Adult video is officially banned, since it is too mentally disturbing. 


### CrappY Internet

LIterally so many things on Internet is CRAP, and what's more, they are addictive and seriously affecting my mental wellbeing. Espeically those adult contents. Ahh, there is no way to completely get rid of them.

CN Websites are also a piece of crap, with unusable buggy frontends and Winnie censoring.


### Gaming IS TOXIC

###FaceReality###NoMoreGames###RegainControl###EscapeTheGame###FuckGaming###Freedom

No more gaming, or else I will create a gaming Log.

### How to ban a website and why excessive control sucks

There are several ways to ban websites

1. Use family server plans like Cloudflare 1.1.1.3 (Blocking Malware and adult websites). Ineffective with VPN.

2. Changing /etc/hosts file, very inefficient indeed, makes computer runs slowly when records go high(millions) since it goes through linear search. Ineffective when using a VPN.

3. Using a squid proxy to route the traffic on another port, and config it globally.

Squid is primarily used for caching and improving web performances, turning out it does improve performance on my computer, although not by much, only about less than 20%(probably because I am also behind ClashVerge vpn).

Anyways, squid can be configed to block websites using external tools like squidguard or e2guardian. But still on the original port the traffic is not blocked.

4. Using a VPN in the first place might block some websites, but these are usually blocked anyways in China. The point of VPN is usually browsing Internet freely, not for more restrictions.

Cloudflare Warp family works to block inappropriate websites, but it's too slow in China, since I needed to first connect to a US server.

5. Using filter rules in ClashVerge vpn (or shadowsocks) blocks website. For example, if you block twitter then twitter will be inaccessible through the vpn, it is also inaccessible in Mainland China, so the site is blocked through the vpn. However, by simply changing a vpn provider one can still bypass.

6. Trying browser extensions. Most ineffective way ever. One can easily bypass by installing another browser. Some browser, like qutebrowser, doesn't support extensions.

7. Trying some parental control software. Extremely bad way. Firstly, those softwares are often complicated to set up, often with much configuration and "gui", which is probabaly the last thing I will try. Furthermore, these softwares complicates the monitoring and censoring, making I feel very uncomfortable, against the point of trying to achieve freedom and comfort through filtering evil websites. Moreover, they eat up system cpu usage and network speed. Lastly, most are ineffective, and may be bypassed by VPN easily.

8. Be "below 18 years old" on Internet. This isn't a method in the first place since although Google search won't return malicious results for children, most malicious(adult) websites doesn't need confirming to enter.

9. Try dropping the iptables. 
``` 
[user ~]$ sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 104.21.68.184 -j DROP
[user ~]$ sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 1 -d 172.67.197.209 -j DROP
```
Ineffective over VPN.

In conclusion it is quite hard to block harmful websites without extensive and a very long time configuration and extensive testing, which is far less time-efficient than normal things to do. Anyways, the main goal is the block inappropriate content, and if browsing inappropriate content is my own will, then I must be responsible for it. There are millions of inappropriate websites in minimum, with more going out everyday. It is almost impossible without a "GUI" or extensive monitoring software for offering such a service effectively.

### What I shall focus preventing on right now?

There are several pretty serious issues to be addressed. Typically

1. Never ever play video games
2. Never ever go on those cn spam platforms

These ARE causing troubles for me right now, also so is my sleeping schedule, but anyways, sleepoing schedule can be adjusted, but these things are such a pain.

If I go on tieba for once I will be addicted with the shit.

### Some previous erros in my website development

I made some pretty ridiculous erros before, for example, I used 2 domains and 2 linode vps for frontend and backend. This can be utilized by using nginx proxy on one Linode machine and configuring a path for the backend.

I also constantly ran `sudo npm start` for my website, which is quite stupid. I shall run `npm run build` for production builds.

### What kind of woman do I want to marry?

Something about me; I aim for freedom and control. This is unnegotiable.

I mean, for people who do not care about their freedom, it's absolutely fine to be friends with them, but to have a spouse to live with like 50 years, it is kind of deeply troublesome.

When I see a girl I immediately release some kind of chemical that makes me excited or what, then I started to think about like being together with this girl, and possibly marrying. But it is very ridiculous thinking, anyways, even if she wants to marry me, will I agree?

I do hope to find someone who is also independent and free-willed, and we can negotiate on other things. But seeing some pretty girls taking, well that really made me not like them anymore.

### Money Spending

I had become very converative at money spending.

- **Autocharging**

Firstly, I just feel bad with "autocharging". This feature derives me of control over my money. I am not someone with extremely good memories, so usually I tend to forget about it. Look, I know it is cheap and not a lot of money or something but it still makes me feel very bad. And lately a scam website called anphlp charged me 26 dollars, which I think came from me signing up for streaming on a scam website with my card.

- **Just Feeling Bad :(**

Secondly, I just feel bad about people taking my money at all. I mean, like to be honest, Google and YouTube deserves to charge me some money since I am using so much searching and watching so much video, without spending a cent. Think about YouTube's spendings on its cdns. And Google's search is on its own platform, and performs in its own cloud, which makes more sense if they charge me.

Anyways I just don't feel like spending any money on websites, they don't give much shit, though. Websites are essentailly programs with a frontend, pretty much anything I can run locally with Aur repos.

I think Linode is ok to charge me five dollars for renting their stable cloud services, so is other cloud providers. But watching a video or movie is nonfree? Using some crap like veed? Oh come on, who wants to watch it anyways?

- **Enough Free Alternatives**

There are millions of free hosting websites that you can stream almost anything or download it. Even porn videos are hosted everywhere. Like straplez videos are hosted on pornhoarder.tv and xfantazy. Other sites with lots of porn videos include like spankbang, noodlemagazine, videosection, etc. By a click I can find almost everything I would want to watch.

I saw on RuTube a channel like marked with 18+, which immediately got my interest, things like European Brazzers. But I searched on Google and I could go on another site to watch these for free. And they are actually pretty boring, like those mediocre (not even high-quality) porn videos poorly stacked together. Why would I take the time to freaking watch those stupid porn channels.

I do acknowledge there are some high-quality videos that needs charging, but anyways, I do not watch videos for a living, and thus I don't really care about the quality if there are similar alternatives. Watching a football match and watching a basketball match seems pretty much same to me anyways.

- **Parents' Money**

Anyways, last and most significant factor is that I am spending my parents' money, which means I have to keep total track of everything. It's not like my parents asked me to do so or something, although they obviously did. It's like just a custom that when like depending on other people you need to keep track of your doings. Depending on my parents' now is the worst thing that can ever happen to me, but there isn't much more ways to earn moeny myself anyways.

### Conclusion on Saving Money

Also saving money doesn't necessarily make me better or feel good, but overspending money do make me feel really bad. Like especially when overspending for not valuable stuffs.


## Some Reflectioin

### A Difficult Semester: Self-Reflection

This semester was a profound disappointment, and I acknowledge my own significant shortcomings:

1. **Failure to Prepare:** I profoundly regret not dedicating adequate time to prepare for my classes before the semester. My lack of foresight and procrastination set the stage for my academic struggles.

2. **Battling Video Game Addiction:** My deep entanglement with video games from September to mid-October significantly derailed my focus and academic responsibilities. The painful process of overcoming this addiction post-midterms was marked by mood swings and a deep sense of loss, reflecting my poor judgement and lack of self-control.

3. **Dislike for Chosen Courses:** My decision to enroll in classes that didn't interest me was a grave mistake. This led to a lack of engagement and enthusiasm, further exacerbating my academic challenges.

## Updates December

I'm genuinely grateful for the extraordinary kindness and assistance I received from an airport worker in San Francisco. Navigating through the complexities of travel can often be daunting, especially when things don't go as planned. My situation was no different – I was stressed and uncertain, having booked a ticket that required a transfer in Canada without the necessary ETA.

In this moment of worry, I was fortunate enough to encounter a wonderful airport employee. Her approachable demeanor and genuine interest in my studies and well-being were a beacon of hope. Her words, "Don't worry, just wait here with me," brought immense comfort. Despite her efforts to reroute my luggage directly to Shanghai, when that didn't work out, she went a step further to offer me a direct flight to my destination.

Now, as I reflect on this experience from Shanghai, I am filled with deep gratitude. The kindness and proactive help of this airport worker not only solved my travel issue but also left a lasting impression on my heart. Her actions are a reminder of the goodness and empathy that people can extend to others, especially in times of need. I'm sincerely thankful for her help and the positive impact she made on my journey.
